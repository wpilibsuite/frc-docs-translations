"Highly reflective materials are generally mirrored so that light \"bounces "
"off\" at a supplementary angle. As shown above-left, the blue and red angles"
" sum to 180 degrees. An equivalent explanation is that the light reflects "
"about the surface normal the green line drawn perpendicular to the surface. "
"Notice that a light pointed at the surface will return to the light source "
"only if the blue angle is ~90 degrees."
msgstr ""
"高反射率的材料通常会成为镜像，以使光线以补充角度“反射”出去。如左上方所示，蓝色和红色角度总计为180度。一个等效的解释是，光线围绕表面法线反射垂直于该表面绘制的绿线。请注意，仅当蓝角约为90度时，指向表面的光才会返回光源。"

"above, the reflected light returns to the eye, and the material shines "

"最初，反射似乎对于夜间安全而言似乎不是有用的属性，但是，如上所示，当光线和眼睛彼此靠近时，反射光会返回到眼睛，并且即使在很远的距离处，该材料也明亮地发光。由于驾驶员的眼睛与车辆前灯之间的夹角较小，因此夜间使用时，逆反射材料可以大大提高远处物体的可见度。"

"Experiment with different light sources. The material is hundreds of times "
"more reflective than white paint; so dim light sources will work fine. For "
"example, a red bicycle safety light will demonstrate that the color of the "
"light source determines the color of the reflected light. If possible, "
"position several team members at different locations, each with their own "
"light source. This will show that the effects are largely independent, and "
"the material can simultaneously appear different colors to various team "
"members. This also demonstrates that the material is largely immune to "
"environmental lighting. The light returning to the viewer is almost entirely"
" determined by a light source they control or one directly behind them. "

"尝试使用不同的光源。这种材料的反射性是白色涂料的数百倍。因此昏暗的光源可以正常工作。例如，红色的自行车安全灯将表明光源的颜色决定了反射光的颜色。如果可能，将几个团队成员放置在不同的位置，每个位置都有自己的光源。这将表明效果在很大程度上是独立的，并且材质可以同时为各个团队成员显示不同的颜色。这也表明该材料在很大程度上不受环境光的影响。返回观察者的光几乎完全由他们控制的光源或直接在他们后面的光源决定。使用手电筒，确定环境中已经存在的其他反光物品：衣服，背包，鞋子等上的物品。"

"We have seen that the retro-reflective tape will not shine unless a light "

"ring flash, or ring light, shown above. It places the light source directly "
