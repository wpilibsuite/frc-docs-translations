"Camera streams from the robot can be viewed on a tab in Shuffleboard. This "
"is useful for viewing what the robot is seeing to give a less obstructed "
"view for operators or helping visualize the output from a vision algorithm "
"running on the driver station computer or a coprocessor on the robot. Any "
"stream that is running using the CameraServer API can be viewed in a camera "
"stream widget."
msgstr ""
"可以在Shuffleboard中的选项卡上查看来自机器人的摄像机流。这对于查看机器人所看到的东西很有用，为操作员提供拥有较少阻碍的视野，或有助于机器操控台中计算机或机器人上的协处理器中视觉算法的可视化输出。可以在相机流小部件中查看使用CameraServer"

"To add a camera to your dashboard select \"Sources\" and view the "
"\"CameraServer\" source in the left side panel in the Shuffleboard window as"
" shown in the example below. A list of camera streams will be shown, in this"
" case there is only one camera called \"Robot Front Camera\". Drag that to "
"the tab where it should be displayed. Alternatively the stream can also be "
"placed on the dashboard by right-clicking on the stream in the Sources list "
"and selecting \"Show as: Camera Stream\"."

"要将摄像机添加到仪表板，请选择“源”，然后在Shuffleboard窗口的左侧面板中查看“ "
"CameraServer”源，如下例所示。摄像机流列表将会显示，在这个例子中，只有一个被称为“Robot Front "
"Camera”的摄像机。将其拖到应该显示它的选项卡上。或者，也可以通过右键单击“源”列表中的流，然后选择“显示为：摄像机流”，将该流放置在仪表板上。"
