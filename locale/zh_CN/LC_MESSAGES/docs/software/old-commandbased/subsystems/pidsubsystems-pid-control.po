"If a mechanism uses a sensor for feedback, then most often a PID controller "
"will be used to control the motor speed or position. Examples of subsystems "
"that might use PID control are: elevators with potentiometers to track the "
"height, shooters with encoders to measure the speed, wrists with "
"potentiometers to measure the joint angle, etc."

"如果机械装置使用传感器进行反馈，则通常会使用PID控制器来控制电动机的速度或位置。可能使用PID控制的子系统示例包括：带电位计的电梯来跟踪高度，带编码器的射手来测量速度，带电位计的手腕来测量关节角度等。"

"There is a PIDController class built into WPILib, but to simplify its use "
"for command based programs there is a PIDSubsystem. A PIDSubsystem is a "
"normal subsystem with the PIDController built in and exposes the required "
"methods for operation."

"WPILib内置了一个PIDController类，但是为了简化对基于指令的程序的使用，有一个PIDSubsystem。 "
"PIDSubsystem是内置PIDController的常规子系统，它公开了所需的操作方法。"
