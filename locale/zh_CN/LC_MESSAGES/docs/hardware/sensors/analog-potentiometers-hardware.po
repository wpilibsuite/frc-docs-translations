"Potentiometers generally have a mechanically-limited travel range.  Users "
"should be careful that their mechanisms do not turn their potentiometers "
"past their maximum travel, as this will damage or destroy the potentiometer."
msgstr "电位计通常具有受机械限制的行程范围。用户应注意其机械装置不要使电位计旋转超过最大行程，因为这会损坏或破坏电位计。"

"Apart from :doc:`quadrature encoders <encoders-hardware>`, another common "
"way of measuring rotation on FRC\\ |reg| robots is with analog "
"potentiometers.  A potentiometer is simply a variable resistor - as the "
"shaft of the potentiometer turns, the resistance changes (usually linearly)."
"  Placing this resistor in a `voltage divider "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider>`__ allows the user to easily"
" measure the resistance by measuring the voltage across the potentiometer, "
"which can then be used to calculate the rotational position of the shaft."

"除 :doc:`quadrature encoders <encoders-"
"hardware>`，另一种常用于测量FRC\\|reg|机器人旋转的方式是使用模拟电位器。一个模拟电位器实际上是一个可调电阻 - "
"当电位器的轴旋转时，电阻的阻值也随之变化（通常是线性的）。应用`voltage divider "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider>`__上可以通过测量电阻两端的电压来测出电阻的阻值，从而可以计算电位器旋转轴的旋转角度。"

"就如其名，模拟电位器需要连接到roboRIO的模拟输入口<analog-inputs-"

"The picture above on the left shows a typical potentiometer.  There are "

" the signal pin, while the outer pins can both be *either* power or ground."

"As mentioned before, a potentiometer is a voltage divider, as shown in the "
"circuit diagram on the right.  As the potentiometer shaft turns, the "
"resistances R1 and R2 change; however, their sum remains constant [1]_.  "
"Thus, the voltage across the entire potentiometer remains constant (for the "
"roboRIO, this would be 5 volts), but the voltage between the signal pin and "
"either the voltage or ground pin varies linearly as the shaft turns."
msgstr ""
"如前所述，电位器是分压器，如右图所示。随着电位计轴的旋转，电阻R1和R2改变；但是，它们的总和保持不变[1]_。因此，整个电位计上的电压保持恒定（对于roboRIO，这将是5伏），但是信号轴与电源或地线引脚之间的电压随轴旋转而线性变化。"

"Since the circuit is symmetric, it is reversible - this allows the user to "
"choose at which end of the travel the measured voltage is zero, and at which"
" end it is 5 volts.  To reverse the directionality of the sensor, it can "
"simply be wired backwards!  Be sure to check the directionality of your "
"potentiometer with a multimeter to be sure it is in the desired orientation "
"before soldering your wires to the contacts."
msgstr ""
"由于电路是对称的，因此也是可逆的——允许用户选择在行程的哪一端测得的电压为零，在哪一端为5伏。若要反转传感器的方向，只需将其供电引脚反向接线即可！在将电线焊接到触点之前，请务必用万用表检查电位计的方向性，以确保其方向正确。"

msgid ""
"An \"absolute encoder\" is an encoder that measures the absolute position of"
" the encoder shaft, rather than the incremental movement (as a "
":doc:`quadrature encoder <encoders-hardware>`) does.  In this respect, "
"absolute encoders are more similar to potentiometers than to incremental "
"encoders.  Many absolute encoders offer a simple analog output - these can "
"be used exactly in the same way as a potentiometer, except their wiring is "
"not generally reversible.  Absolute encoders have the advantage of lacking a"
" hard travel limit - the signal will simply reset when the shaft crosses the"
" zero point. The analog potentiometer pictured above can be found at "
"`AndyMark <https://www.andymark.com/products/absolute-encoder-with-"
"cable>`__."
msgstr ""
"“绝对编码器”是一种编码器，它测量编码器轴的绝对位置，而不是增量运动（如正交编码器<encoders-"
"hardware>一样）。在这方面，绝对编码器与电位器更像，而不是增量编码器。许多绝对值编码器都提供简单的模拟输出——可以完全与电位计相同的方式使用它们，但其接线通常不可逆"
"。绝对值编码器的优点是没有硬行程限制-当轴超过零点时，信号将简单地复位。上图中的绝对编码器可以在这里找到`AndyMark "

"The way this actually works is generally by having the shaft control the "
"position of a contact along a resistive \"wiper\" of fixed length along "
"which the current flows - the resistance is proportional to the length of "
"wiper between the contact and the end of the wiper."
msgstr "其工作原理通常是，电位器旋转轴的刷头与一端固定长度的环状电阻材料想接触，电流从中流过。其阻值与刷头和电阻接触点到电阻材料末端的长度相关。"
