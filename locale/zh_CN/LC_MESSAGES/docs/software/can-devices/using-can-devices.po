"CAN has many advantages over other methods of connection between the robot "
"controller and peripheral devices."
msgstr "CAN连接比其他连接机器人控制板与外部装置的方法有着更多的优点。"

msgid ""
"CAN connections are daisy-chained from device to device, which often results"
" in much shorter wire runs than having to wire each device to the RIO "
"itself."
msgstr "CAN连接以菊链的形式连接设备，这种方式与将每个设备都连接到RIO上的接线时间短得多。"

msgid ""
"Much more data can be sent over a CAN connection than over a PWM connection "
"- thus, CAN motor controllers are capable of a much more expansive feature-"
"set than are PWM motor controllers."
msgstr "CAN连接比起PWM连接可以传送更多的数据，因此CAN电机比PWM电机可以拥有更多的功能。"

msgid ""
"CAN is bi-directional, so CAN motor controllers can send data back to the "
"RIO, again facilitating a more expansive feature-set than can be offered by "
"PWM Controllers."
msgstr "CAN连接是双向的，所以CAN电机可以把数据传回RIO，因此CAN电机比PWM电机可以拥有更多的功能。"
