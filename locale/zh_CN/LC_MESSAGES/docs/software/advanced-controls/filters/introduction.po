"Filters are some of the most common tools used in modern technology, and "
"find numerous applications in robotics in both signal processing and "
"controls.  Understanding the notion of a filter is crucial to understanding "
"the utility of the various types of filters provided by WPILib."
msgstr ""
"滤波器是现代技术中最常用的工具之一，在机器人的信号处理和控制的中有广泛的应用。理解过滤器的概念对于理解WPILib提供的各种类型的过滤器的实用性至关重要。"

"For the sake of this article, we will assume all data are single-dimensional"
" time-series data.  Obviously, the concepts involved are more general than "
"this - but a full/rigorous discussion of signals and filtering is out of the"
" scope of this documentation."
msgstr ""
"为了本文的方便，我们将假定所有数据均为一维的时间序列数据。显然，滤波器的概念并非仅仅如此，但对信号和滤波完整，严格的讨论超出了本文档的讨论。"

"So, what exactly *is* a filter, then?  Simply put, a filter is a mapping "
"from a stream of inputs to a stream of outputs.  That is to say, the value "
"output by a filter (in principle) can depend not only on the *current* value"
" of the input, but on *the entire set of past and future values* (of course,"
" in practice, the filters provided by WPILib are implementable in real-time "
"on streaming data; accordingly, they can only depend on the *past* values of"
" the input, and not on future values).  This is an important concept, "
"because generally we use filters to remove/mitigate unwanted *dynamics* from"
" a signal.  When we filter a signal, we're interested in modifying *how the "
"signal changes over time*."
msgstr ""
"那么，什么才是过滤器呢？简而言之，过滤器是从输入流到输出流的映射。也就是说，过滤器输出的值（原则上）不仅可以取决于输入的当前值，还可以取决于过去和将来的值的整个集合（当然，实际上，WPILib提供的滤波器只能数据流上实时实现；因此，它们只能取决于过去的输入值，而不能取决于将来的值）。这是一个重要的概念，因为通常我们使用滤波器来去除或减轻信号中不需要的动态特性。当我们过滤信号时，我们要修改信号随时间的变化。"

msgid ""
"One of the most typical uses of a filter is for noise reduction.  A filter "
"that reduces noise is called a *low-pass* filter (because it allows low "
"frequencies to \"pass through,\" while blocking high-frequencies).  Most of "
"the filters currently included in WPILib are effectively low-pass filters."
msgstr ""
"滤波器最典型的用途之一就是降低噪声。降低噪声的滤波器称为低通滤波器（因为它允许低频“通过”，并阻止高频）。当前WPILib中包含的大多数滤波器实际上都是低通滤波器。"

msgid "Rate Limiting"
msgstr "速率限制"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction.rst:24
msgid ""
"Filters are also commonly used to reduce the rate at which a signal can "
"change.  This is closely related to noise reduction, and filters that reduce"
" noise also tend to limit the rate of change of their output."
msgstr "滤波器通常也用于降低信号变化的速率。这与降噪密切相关，并且降低噪声的滤波器也往往会限制信号变化的速率。"

msgid "Edge Detection"
msgstr "边缘探测"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction.rst:29
msgid ""
"The counterpart to the low-pass filter is the high-pass filter, which only "
"permits high frequencies to pass through to the output.  High-pass filters "
"can be somewhat tricky to build intuition for, but a common usage for a "
"high-pass filter is edge-detection - since high-pass filters will reflect "
"sudden changes in the input while ignoring slower changes, they are useful "
"for determining the location of sharp discontinuities in the signal."
msgstr ""
"与低通滤波器相对应的是高通滤波器，它只允许高频通过输出。高通滤波器很难用直觉理解, 但它被普遍用于边缘检测, "
"因为高通滤波器将反映输入的突然变化而忽略慢变化, 可以用于决定大幅不连续的信号。"

msgid "Phase Lag"
msgstr "相位滞后"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction.rst:34
msgid ""
"An unavoidable negative effect of a real-time low-pass filter is the "
"introduction of \"phase lag.\"  Since, as mentioned earlier, a real-time "
"filter can only depend on past values of the signal (we cannot time-travel "
"to obtain the future values), the filtered value takes some time to \"catch "
"up\" when the input starts changing.  The greater the noise-reduction, the "
"greater the introduced delay.  This is, in many ways, *the* fundamental "
"trade-off of real-time filtering, and should be the primary driving factor "
"of your filter design."
msgstr ""
"实时低通滤波器不可避免的一个负面影响是“相位滞后”的引入。正如前面提到的，实时滤波器只能依赖于信号的过去值(我们不能通过时间旅行来获得未来值)，因此当输入开始变化时，滤波后的值需要一段时间才能“赶上”。降噪越大，引入的延迟就越大。在许多方面，这是实时过滤基本的权衡，并且应该是您的过滤器设计的主要考虑因素。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/advanced-controls/filters/introduction.rst:36
msgid ""
"Interestingly, high-pass filters introduce a phase *lead*, as opposed to a "
"phase lag, as they exacerbate local changes to the value of the input."
msgstr "有趣的是，高通滤波器引入了相位超前，而不是相位滞后，因为它们加剧了输入值的局部变化。"
