"The intended use case for the OM5P-AC radio does not subject it to the same "

" subjected to significant pressure on the bottom of the case, it is possible"
" to cause a radio reboot by shorting a metal shield at the bottom of the "

"details a modification to the radio to prevent this scenario."

"OM5P-AC路由器可能会在FRC \\ "
"|reg|环境中遭受不确定的冲击和震动。如果路由器在外壳底层受到很大的压力，则可能通过将路由器底部的金属层接触到电路板底部的一些裸露的金属引线而短路来导致路由器重新启动。本文详细介绍了如何修改路由器，以防止出现这种情况。"
