"The purpose of the Motor Safety mechanism is the same as the purpose of a "

"people or property if the code locks up and does not properly update the "

"basis so that you can appropriately determine where it is necessary and "
"where it is not. Examples of mechanisms that should have motor safety "
"enabled are systems like drive trains and arms. If these systems get latched"
" on a particular value they could cause damage to their environment or "
"themselves. An example of a mechanism that may not need motor safety is a "
"spinning flywheel for a shooter. If this mechanism gets latched on a "
