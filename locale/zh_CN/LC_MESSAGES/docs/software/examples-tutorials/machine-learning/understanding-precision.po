"truth."

"Predicted objects - This is when the trained neural network detects an "

"Epoch - When you provide a dataset of labeled images to the training, we "
"take 70% of the images as input to the neural network for training, and 30% "
"of the images for validating the trained neural network against.  One Epoch "
"is when it has gone through a cycle of training and validating with all the "
"supplied images.  A neural network gets better when it goes through many "
"cycles of the training and validating."

"当您为训练提供标签图像的数据集时，我们将70％的图像作为输入到神经网络进行训练，而将30％的图像用作验证训练后的神经网络的输入。一个纪元就是经过所有提供的图像的训练和验证周期之后。当神经网络经历训练和验证的许多周期时，它会变得更好。"

"Now for some of the nuances in looking at the accuracy.  Let's say we have a"
" GroundTruth image with 5 cargo and 4 hatches labeled on it.  To start with "
"let's just look at Cargo.  The systems takes the GroundTruth image and "
"compares it with the hand labeled bounding boxes and the predicted bounding "
"boxes. The prediction shows 4 cargo.  3 are actual cargo and 1 is the person"
" in the stands with an orange shirt on. There are two interesting numbers "
"here.  One is called Recall.  The Recall is out of 5 true cargos it "
"recognized 3.  This means the recall is 3/5.  The next number is precision."
"  The precision is that out of 4 recognized cargo 3 where correct.  Making "
"the Precision 3/4.  These numbers many times turn out to be inversely "
"related.  So when there is more recall, the accuracy may go down, more false"
" positives.  And when the recall goes down there may be better accuracy or "
"fewer false positives.  In order to find a good way to represent these two "
"numbers another number is calculated.  This is call the Average Precision "
"(AP).   This is done by taking the amount of precision at each level of "
"recall, creating a Precision Recall curve.  The calculation for this is very"
" interesting and worth looking up if you are interested.  All of these are "
"done every 100 Epochs in our case. Then this is done for each of the "
"classes, Cargo and then Hatches.  And the mean, or average, are taken for "
"the AP of each of the classes to make the mean Average Precision or mAP.  "
"This gives us a pretty good feeling for the accuracy, but there is one more "
"consideration around locality.  If you take the bounding box from the "
"GroundTruth for and object and the predicted bounding box and overlap them, "
"you want at least 50% of those boxes to intersect. If not, the predicted "
"object is not accurate enough to be considered a match.  This overlapping "
"intersection is referred to as Intersection over Union (IoU).  Different "
"accuracy checks use different percentages of IoU, but we are going to stick "
"with >50%."

"现在来看一下准确性的一些细微差别。假设我们有一个GroundTruth图像，上面有5个货物和4个舱口标记。首先，让我们看一下货运。系统获取GroundTruth图像，并将其与带有手工标记的边界框和预测的边界框进行比较。预测显示有4架货物。"
" "
"3是实际货物，1是身穿橙色衬衫的看台上的人。这里有两个有趣的数字。一种叫做召回。召回数量是其识别出的5件真实货物中的3件。这意味着召回率是3/5。下一个数字是精度。精度是在4个已识别的货物3中正确的位置。使精度3/4。这些数字多次被证明是成反比的。因此，当召回次数更多时，准确性可能会下降，出现更多的误报。当召回事件减少时，准确性可能更高，或者误报率会更低。为了找到表示这两个数字的好方法，计算了另一个数字。这称为平均精度（AP）。这是通过在每个召回级别上获取精度值，创建精确召回曲线来完成的。对此的计算非常有趣，如果您有兴趣的话，值得查阅。在我们的案例中，所有这些操作都是每100个纪元完成的。然后，针对每个类别（货运和舱口盖）执行此操作。取每个类别的AP的均值或平均值，以得出平均平均精度或mAP。这使我们对准确性有一种很好的感觉，但是围绕局部性还有更多考虑因素。如果从GroundTruth中的和对象取边界框并与预测的边界框重叠，则希望它们中的至少50％相交。如果不是，则预测的对象不够精确，无法被视为匹配。此重叠的交集称为“联合交集”（IoU）。不同的准确性检查使用不同的IoU百分比，但我们将坚持>"
" 50％。"

"So now if we look at the mAP for an IoU greater than 50% it gives us a level"
" of accuracy that we can understand.  When training a network you want this "
"number to go up over the number of Epochs. Not too fast, and many times "
"there will be an early peak to this number, but that can be due to what is "
"called overfitting, where it is just matching the validation images, but "
"won't work as well on the general case of the video camera on your robot.  "
"So you want to train until this number stops going up when looking at a "
"smoothed curve.  If the accuracy never gets up that high, it may be that you"
" need to change some of your hyperparameters, like the number of Epochs or "
"Batch size.  Or it could be that you need more labeled or better labeled "
"images in your dataset.  This tuning is part of the \"magic\" of machine "
"learning.  Certainly over time one gets a better intuition on how to tune a "
"network, but there is at this time a direct correlation to when you see this"
" type of curve, change this parameter to improve it."
msgstr ""
"因此，现在，如果我们将IoU的mAP视为大于50％，那么它将为我们提供我们可以理解的准确度。训练网络时，您希望此数字超过Epoch的数量。不太快，很多时候这个数字会达到一个高峰，但这可能是由于所谓的过拟合，它只与验证图像匹配，但在一般情况下效果不佳机器人上的视频摄像机。因此，您要进行训练，直到在观察平滑曲线时该数字停止上升为止。如果精度永远不会达到那么高的水平，则可能是您需要更改某些超参数，例如历元数或批处理大小。也可能是您在数据集中需要更多标记或标记更好的图像。这种调整是机器学习“魔术”的一部分。当然，随着时间的流逝，人们对如何调整网络有了更好的直觉，但是此时与看到这种类型的曲线有直接的关联，请更改此参数以对其进行改进。"
