"Commands can be nested inside of command groups to create more complex "
"commands. The simpler commands can be added to the command groups to either "
"run sequentially (each command finishing before the next starts) or in "
"parallel (the command is scheduled, and the next command is immediately "
"scheduled also). Occasionally there are times where you want to make sure "
"that two parallel command complete before moving onto the next command. This"
" article describes how to do that."
msgstr ""
"可以将指令嵌套在指令组内部以创建更复杂的指令。可以将更简单的指令添加到指令组中，以依次运行（每个指令在下一个启动之前完成）或并行运行（计划该指令，并且也立即计划下一个指令）。有时，您需要确保在执行下一个指令之前完成两个并行指令。本文介绍了如何执行此操作。"

"In this example some commands are added in parallel and others are added "
"sequentially to the CommandGroup CoopBridgeAutonomous (1). The first command"
" \"SetTipperState\" is added and completes before the SetVirtualSetpoint "
"command starts (2). Before SetVirtualSetpoint command completes, the "
"DriveToBridge command is immediately scheduled because of the "
"SetVirtualSetpoint is added in parallel (3). This example might give you an "
"idea of how commands are scheduled."

"在此示例中，一些指令被并行添加，而其他指令则顺序添加到CommandGroup CoopBridgeAutonomous（1）。添加第一个指令“ "
"SetTipperState”，并在SetVirtualSetpoint指令开始之前完成（2）。在SetVirtualSetpoint指令完成之前，会立即计划DriveToBridge指令，因为SetVirtualSetpoint是并行添加的（3）。该示例可能使您了解如何调度指令。"

"Here is the code shown above represented as a flowchart.  Any command in the"
" main sequence (the sequence on the right here) that requires a subsystem in"
" use by a parallel command will cause the parallel command to be canceled. "
"For example, if the ``FireSequence`` required a subsystem in use by "
"``SetVirtualSetpoint``, the ``SetVirtualSetpoint`` command will be canceled "
"when ``FireSequence`` is scheduled."
msgstr ""
"这是上面显示为流程图的代码。主序列（此处为右侧序列）中需要并行指令使用子系统的任何指令都将导致并行指令被取消。例如，如果“ "
"FireSequence”需要由“ SetVirtualSetpoint”使用的子系统，则在计划“ FireSequence”时将取消“ "
"SetVirtualSetpoint”指令。"

"If there are two commands that need to complete before the following "
"commands are scheduled, they can be put into a command group by themselves, "
"adding both in parallel. Then that command group can be scheduled "
"sequentially from an enclosing command group. When a command group is "
"scheduled sequentially, the commands inside it will all finish before the "
"next outer command is scheduled. In this way you can be sure that an action "
"consisting of multiple parallel commands has completed before going on to "
"the next command."
msgstr ""
"如果在计划以下指令之前需要完成两个指令，则可以将它们自己放入指令组，并并行添加。然后，可以从一个封闭的指令组中依次调度该指令组。依次调度指令组后，内部的指令将在调度下一个外部指令之前全部完成。这样，您可以确保在继续下一个指令之前，由多个并行指令组成的操作已完成。"

"In this example you can see that the addition of a command group \"Move to "
"Bridge\" containing the **Set Virtual Setpoint** and **Drive to Bridge** "
"commands forces both to complete before the next commands are scheduled."
msgstr "在此示例中，您可以看到添加了包含“设置虚拟设定点”和“驱动器到桥”指令的“移动到桥”指令组，这两个指令组都必须在计划下一个指令之前完成。"
