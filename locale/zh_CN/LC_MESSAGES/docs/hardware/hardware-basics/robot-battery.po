"A battery is rated for about 1200 normal charge/recharge cycles. The high "
"currents required for an FRC match reduce that lifespan to about 400 cycles."
" These cycles are intended to be relatively low discharge, from around 13.5 "
"down to 12 or 12.5 volts. Deep cycling the battery (running it all the way "
"down) will damage it."

"电池的额定正常充电/充电周期约为1200次。 "
"FRC匹配所需的高电流将使用寿命缩短到约400个周期。这些循环旨在实现相对较低的放电，从大约13.5伏降至12伏或12.5伏。深度循环使用电池（将其完全耗尽）会损坏电池。"
