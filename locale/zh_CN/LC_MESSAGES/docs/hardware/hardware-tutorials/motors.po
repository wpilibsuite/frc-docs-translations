"One of the most important design decisions that teams have to deal with is "
"selecting and designing the motor driven systems on their robot. So often "
"the incorrect motor is chosen for a particular design yielding reduced "
"performance and, sometimes even worse, motors failing from excessive current"
" draw. In this series of videos, WPI Professor Ken Stafford walks through "
"how motors work, how to design systems to operate at maximum performance, "
"and a sample design for a robot system."

"设计机器人时，每个团队往往在机器人电动驱动系统的选择上面临抉择。选择不正确的电动机会降低性能，有时甚至会因过多的电流消耗而使电机失效。在本系列视频中，WPI教授Ken"
" Stafford教授了电机的工作原理，如何设计以最佳性能运行的系统以及机器人系统的示例设计。"
