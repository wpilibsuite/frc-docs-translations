#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:40
msgid ""
"Like ultrasonics, LIDAR relies on the reflection of the emitted pulse back "
"to the sensor.  Thus, LIDAR critically depends on the reflectivity of the "
"material in the wavelength of the laser.  The FRC field wall is made of "
"polycarbonate, which tends to be transparent in the infrared wavelength "
"(which is what is generally legal for FRC use).  Thus, LIDAR tends to "
"struggle to detect the field barrier."
msgstr ""
"像超声波一样，激光雷达依靠发射的脉冲反射回传感器。因此，激光雷达关键取决于材料在激光波长中的反射率。 "
"FRC场墙由聚碳酸酯制成，在红外波长下它往往是透明的（这在FRC的使用中通常是合法的）。因此，LIDAR往往难以检测到场障。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:42
msgid ""
"2D LIDAR sensors (at the price range legal for FRC use) tend to be quite "
"noisy, and processing their measured data (known as a \"point cloud\") can "
"involve a lot of complex software.  Additionally, there are very few 2D "
"LIDAR sensors made specifically for FRC, so software support tends to be "
"scarce."
msgstr ""
"2D LIDAR传感器（在FRC使用的合法价格范围内）往往噪声很大，处理其测量数据（称为“点云”）可能涉及许多复杂软件。此外，专门为FRC制造的2D "
"LIDAR传感器很少，因此软件支持趋于匮乏。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:44
msgid ""
"As 2D LIDAR sensors rely on a turntable to work, their update rate is "
"limited by the rate at which the turntable spins.  For sensors in the price "
"range legal for FRC, this often means that they do not update their values "
"particularly quickly, which can be a limitation when the robot (or the "
"targets) are moving."
msgstr ""
"由于2D "
"LIDAR传感器依靠转盘工作，因此其更新速度受到转盘旋转速度的限制。对于FRC合法价格范围内的传感器，这通常意味着它们不会特别快地更新其值，这在机器人（或目标）移动时可能会受到限制。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:46
msgid ""
"Additionally, as 2D LIDAR sensors are limited in *angular* resolution, the "
"*spatial* resolution of the point cloud is worse when targets are further "
"away."
msgstr "此外，由于2维LIDAR传感器的*角度*分辨率受到限制，所以当目标距离较远时，点云的*空间*分辨率会变差。"
