msgid ""
"``withSize`` sets the number of columns wide and rows high the widget should"
" be. For example, calling ``withSize(1, 1)`` makes the widget occupy a "
"single cell in the grid. Note that some widgets have a minimum size that may"
" be greater than the specified size, in which case the widget will use the "
"smallest supported size."
msgstr ""
"“withSize”设置小部件应有的列宽和行高的数量。例如，调用` withSize ( 1，1 ) "
"'使得小部件在网格中占据一个单元格。注意一些小部件的最小尺寸可能大于指定尺寸，在这种情况下小部件将使用最小的支持尺寸。"

msgid ""
"``withPosition`` sets the row and column of the top-left corner of the "
"widget. Rows and columns are both 0-indexed, so the topmost row is number 0 "
"and the leftmost column is also number 0. If the position of any widget in a"
" tab is specified, every widget should also have its position set to avoid "
"overlapping widgets."
msgstr ""
"withPosition设置窗口小部件左上角的行和列。行和列都索引为0，因此最上面的行是数字0，最左边的列也是数字0。如果指定了选项卡中任何窗口小部件的位置，则每个窗口小部件的位置也应设置为避免窗口小部件重叠。"

"If there are many widgets in a tab with related data, it can be useful to "
"place them into smaller subgroups instead of loose in the tab. Much like how"
" the handle to a tab is retrieved with ``Shuffleboard.getTab``, a layout "
"inside a tab (or even in another layout) can be retrieved with "
"``ShuffleboardTab.getLayout``."
msgstr ""
"如果选项卡中包含相关数据的小部件很多，那么将它们放置在较小的子组中而不是将其散布在选项卡中会很有用。就像使用Shuffleboard.getTab检索选项卡的句柄一样，可以使用ShuffleboardTab.getLayout检索选项卡内的布局（甚至在另一个布局中）。"
