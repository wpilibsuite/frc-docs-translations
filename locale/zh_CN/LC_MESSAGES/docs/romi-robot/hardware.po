"Push the Mini Plastic Gearmotors into the motor clips until they snap into "
"place. Note that the motor blocks the clip release, so if you need to remove"
" a motor bracket later, you will first need to remove the motor. The Mini "
"Plastic Gearmotors that come with the kit have extended motor shafts to "
"enable quadrature encoders for position feedback."
msgstr ""
"将微型塑料齿轮马达推入马达夹，直到它们卡住。注意，电机阻塞夹释放，因此，如果您稍后需要拆卸电机支架，您将首先需要拆卸电机。迷你塑料齿轮马达和有扩展的电机轴结合以得到正交编码器的位置反馈。"

"Press the wheels onto the output shafts of the motors until the motor shaft "
"is flush with the outer face of the wheel. One way to do this is to set the "
"wheel on a flat surface and line the chassis up with it so that the flat "
"part of the motor’s D-shaft lines up correctly with the wheel. Then, lower "
"the chassis, pressing the motor shaft into the wheel until it contacts the "
"surface."
msgstr ""
"将轮组压在电机的输出轴上，直到电机轴与轮组的外表面齐平。通过使电机的D轴的平坦部分与车轮正确地排列来将轮组和底盘设置在同一个平坦的表面。然后，放下底盘，将电机轴压入车轮，直到它接触到表面。"

msgstr ""
"将底盘倒过来，将后滚珠脚轮的三个滚轮放入底盘的开口内。将1英寸塑料球放在三个滚轮的顶部。然后推滚珠脚轮保留夹并在球和进入底盘时滑入到他们各自的位置。"

"band around the two hooks located on either side of the ball caster on the "
"top side of the chassis."
msgstr " 可选:前球脚轮是由一个灵活的手臂支持，作为一个悬挂系统。如果你想让它更硬，你可以在底盘顶部的滚珠轮两侧的两个挂钩上包一个橡皮筋。"

"Install the standoffs to support the Raspberry Pi board. Two standoffs "
"(thread side down) mount in the holes on the side of the Romi board closest "
"to the \"Romi 32U4\" label as shown in the picture. The nuts for these "
"standoffs are inside the battery compartment. The other two standoffs go "
"into the holes on the opposite side of the board. To attach them, you will "
"need a needle-nose pliers to hold the nut while you screw in the standoffs. "
"The circled holes in the image below show where the standoffs should go."
msgstr ""
" 安装支架以支持树莓派板。两个压铆螺母(螺纹侧向下)安装在最接近“Romi "
"32U4”标签的Romi板的孔中，如图所示。这些防护栏的螺母在电池箱里。另外两个压铆螺母进了板对面的洞里。要连接它们，你需要一个尖嘴钳来固定螺母，而你螺丝在压铆螺母中。下图中圈出的洞显示了压铆螺母的位置。"

msgstr ""
"底盘工作需要4或6节AA电池(我们建议使用可充电AA镍氢电池)。电池的正确方向是由电池形状的孔在Romi底盘以及底盘本身的+和-指示器指示。"

msgstr ""
"将树莓派板倒置，小心对准Pi上的2x20针连接器与Romi上的2x20针插座。用均匀的压力推，注意不要弯曲任何插销。插入后，使用所提供的螺丝将树莓派板固定到上一步安装的支架上。"
