"Commands are easily tested by adding a button to Shuffleboard/SmartDashboard"
" to trigger the command. In this way, no integration with the rest of the "
"robot program is necessary and commands can easily be independently tested. "
"This is the easiest way to verify commands since with a single line of code "
"in your program, a button can be created on Shuffleboard that will run the "
"command. These buttons can then be left in place to verify subsystems and "
"command operations in the future."
msgstr ""
"通过向 Shuffleboard/SmartDashboard "
"添加按钮来触发指令，可以轻松测试指令。通过这种方式，不需要与机器人程序的其余部分集成，并且可以轻松地独立测试指令。这是验证指令的最简单方法，因为在程序中使用一行代码，就可以在"
" Shuffleboard 上创建一个按钮来运行指令。然后可以将这些按钮留在原位以在将来验证子系统和命令操作。"

"This has the added benefit of accommodating multiple programmers, each "
"writing commands. As the code is checked into the main robot project, the "
"commands can be individually tested."
msgstr "这个带来的额外好处是它能够更好地协调数个同时在给出指令的程序部分。当代码被写入机器的主程序项目后，每个指令都可以被拉出来单独调试。"

"The button is created on the SmartDashboard by putting an instance of the "

"automatically generated for you."
msgstr ""
"通过将机器人命令的实例放置到仪表板上，可以在SmartDashboard上创建按钮。这是一种非常常见的操作，因此已将其作为复选框添加到RobotBuilder。编写命令时，请确保已选中该复选框，然后按钮将自动生成。"

"method to be called."

"按钮将自动生成并显示在仪表板屏幕上。您可以重新排列 Shuffleboard "

msgid ""
"Commands can be added to the Shuffleboard manually by writing the code "
"yourself. This is done by passing instances of the command to the PutData "
"method along with the name that should be associated with the button on the "
"Shuffleboard. These instances are scheduled whenever the button is pressed. "
"The result is exactly the same as RobotBuilder generated code, although "
"clicking the checkbox in RobotBuilder is much easier than writing all the "
"code by hand."
msgstr ""
"可以通过自己编写代码将命令手动添加到 Shuffleboard。这是通过将指令的实例以及应该与 Shuffleboard 上的按钮相关联的名称传递给 "
"PutData 方法来完成的。只要按下按钮，就会安排这些实例。结果与 RobotBuilder 生成的代码完全相同，尽管单击 RobotBuilder "
"中的复选框比手动编写所有代码要容易得多。"
