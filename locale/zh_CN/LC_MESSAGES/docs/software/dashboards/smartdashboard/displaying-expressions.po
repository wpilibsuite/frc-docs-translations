"Often debugging or monitoring the status of a robot involves writing a "
"number of values to the console and watching them stream by. With "
"SmartDashboard you can put values to a GUI that is automatically constructed"
" based on your program. As values are updated, the corresponding GUI element"
" changes value - there is no need to try to catch numbers streaming by on "
"the screen."
msgstr ""
"一般在调试或检测机器人的状态时，需要将一些参数传入控制台并观察他们的变化。在智能仪表盘的帮助下，你将可以把参数输进一个基于你得程序而自动生成的图形化用户界面。随着参数的更新，相应图形界面元素的值也将会改变。用户大可不必用肉眼捕捉屏幕上变化的参数。"

"You can write Boolean, Numeric, or String values to the SmartDashboard by "
"simply calling the correct method for the type and including the name and "
"the value of the data, no additional code is required. Any time in your "
"program that you write another value with the same name, it appears in the "
"same UI element on the screen on the driver station or development computer."
" As you can imagine this is a great way of debugging and getting status of "
"your robot as it is operating."
msgstr ""
"当你需要将布尔值/数值/字符串作为参数输入智能仪表盘中时，你可以直接调用对应类型的方法并输入参数的名称和参数的具体值。你不需要写任何其他的复杂代码。当你的程序中有两个值被赋予了同样的参数名，他们将被置入同一个图形化用户界面元素下并显示在操作台或开发者电脑的屏幕上。正如你所想的那样，这将是一种极佳的调试方法。"

"Widgets are populated on the SmartDashboard automatically, no user "

"value is first written, you may need to enable your robot in a particular "
"mode or trigger a particular code routine for an item to appear. To alter "
"the appearance of the widget, see the next two sections :doc:`Changing the "
"Display Properties of a Value <changing-display-properties>` and "
":doc:`Changing the Display Widget Type for a Value <changing-display-widget-"

"窗口小部件会被自动填充在智能仪表盘上而不需要用户干预。需要注意的是，小部件仅会在数值第一次被写入时添加。为了使某些特定项目出现，你可能需要以特定模式启动机器人或触发特定代码例程。当你想要更改小部件的外观时，请参考以下两章的内容：“更改值的显示属性"

"This usually isn't a problem if the program isn't constantly changing, but "
"if the program is in development and the set of keys being added to "
"NetworkTables is constantly changing, then it might be necessary to do the "
"restart of everything to accurately see what is current."
msgstr ""
"如果程序没有在不断变化，这通常不是问题，但是如果程序正在开发中，并且添加到NetworkTables的键组在不断变化，那么可能需要重新启动所有程序以准确查看当前是什么。"
