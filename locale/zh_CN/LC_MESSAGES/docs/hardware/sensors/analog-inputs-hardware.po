"An `analog signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal>`__ is a "
"signal whose value can lie anywhere in a continuous interval.  This lies in "
"stark contrast to a :doc:`digital signal <digital-inputs-hardware>`, which "
"can take only one of several discrete values.  The roboRIO's analog input "
"ports allow the measurement of analog signals with values from 0V to 5V."
msgstr ""
"模拟信号 `analog signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal>`__ "
"是一种信号，其值可以位于连续间隔内的任何位置。这与数字信号形成鲜明对比，数字信号<digital-inputs-"
"hardware>只能采用几个离散值之一。 roboRIO的模拟输入端口允许测量0V至5V范围内的模拟信号。"

"In practice, there is no way to measure a \"true\" analog signal with a "
"digital device such as a computer (like the roboRIO).  Accordingly, the "
"analog inputs are actually measured as a 12-bit digital signal - however, "
"this is quite a high resolution [1]_."

"模拟输入通常（但不总是）用于其测量值在一定范围内连续变化的传感器，例如超声波测距仪<ultrasonics-hardware>和电位计<analog-"
