"A common use case is to have a joystick that should drive some actuators "

"The last step is to make the Tank Drive command be the \"Default Command\" "
"for the Drive Train subsystem. This means that whenever no other command is "
"using the Drive Train, the Joysticks will be in control. This is probably "
"the desirable behavior. When the autonomous code is running, it will also "
"require the drive train and interrupt the Tank Drive command. When the "
"autonomous code is finished, the DriveWithJoysticks command will restart "
"automatically (because it is the default command), and the operators will be"
" back in control. If you write any code that does teleop automatic driving, "
"those commands should also \"require\" the DriveTrain so that they too will "
"interrupt the Tank Drive command and have full control."

"最后一步是使 Tank Drive 指令成为 Drive Train 子系统的“默认指令”。这意味着只要没有其他指令使用 Drive "
"Train，操纵杆将处于控制之中。这可能是理想的行为。当自动阶段代码运行时，它还需要传动系统并中断 Tank Drive "
"指令。自动阶段代码完成后，DriveWithJoysticks "
"指令将自动重新启动（因为它是默认命令），操作员将重新获得控制权。如果您编写任何执行遥控自动驾驶的代码，这些指令也应该“需要”DriveTrain，以便它们也会中断"
