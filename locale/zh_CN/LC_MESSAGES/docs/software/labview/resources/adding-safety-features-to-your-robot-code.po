"A common problem with complex projects is making sure that all of your code "
"is executing when you expect it to. Problems can arise when tasks with high "
"priority, long execution times, or frequent calls hog processing power on "
"the roboRIO. This leads to what is known as \"starvation\" for the tasks "
"that are not able to execute due to the processor being busy. In most cases "
"this will simply slow the reaction time to your input from the joysticks and"
" other devices. However, this can also cause the drive motors of your robot "
"to stay on long after you try to stop them. To avoid any robotic "
"catastrophes from this, you can implement safety features that check for "
"task input starvation and automatically shut down potentially harmful "
"operations."
msgstr ""
"复杂项目的常见问题是确保所有代码都能按预期执行。当优先级高，执行时间长或频繁调用roboRIO的处理能力任务持续运行时，可能会出现问题。这导致由于处理器繁忙而无法执行其他任务。在大多数情况下，这只会减慢处理器对来自操纵杆和其他设备的输入的反应时间。但是，这也可能导致机器人的驱动电机在下达停止命令后仍保持运转很长时间。为了避免一切灾祸，您可以实施安全功能，以检查命令输入是否缺乏处理，并自动关闭可能有害的操作。"

"In all of the Safety Configuration functions, you can enable and disable the"
" safety checks while your programming is running and configure what timeout "
"you think is appropriate. The functions keep a cache of all devices that "
"have the safety enabled and will check if any of them have exceeded their "
"time limit. If any has, all devices in the cache will be disabled and the "
"robot will come to an immediate stop or have its relay/PWM/solenoid outputs "
"turned off. The code below demonstrates how to use the Drive Safety "
"Configuration functions to set a maximum time limit that the motors will "
"receive no input before being shut off."

"在所有安全配置功能中，您可以在程序运行时启用和禁用这些安全检查，并配置您认为合适的最大时间限制。这些功能会管理一个所有启用了安全性的设备的缓存，并会检查其中是否有超过其时间限制的设备。如果有，则将禁用缓存中的所有设备，并且机器将立即停止或关闭其继电器/"
" PWM /电磁阀输出。下面的代码演示了如何使用“驱动器安全配置”功能来设置最大时间限制，即电动机在关闭之前所能接受的最长无输入时长。"
