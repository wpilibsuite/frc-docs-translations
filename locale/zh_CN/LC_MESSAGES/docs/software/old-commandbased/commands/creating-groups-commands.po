"This is an example of a command group that places a soda can on a table. To "
"accomplish this, (1) the robot elevator must move to the ``TABLE_HEIGHT``, "
"then (2) set the wrist angle, then (3) open the claw. All of these tasks "
"must run sequentially to make sure that the soda can isn't dropped. The "
"``addSequential()`` method takes a command (or a command group) as a "
"parameter and will execute them one after another when this command is "
"scheduled."
msgstr ""
"这是将汽水罐放在桌子上的指令组的示例。为此，（1）机器人电梯必须移至``TABLE_HEIGHT''，然后（2）设置腕部角度，然后（3）打开爪子。所有这些任务都必须按顺序运行，以确保汽水罐不掉落。"
" addSequential（）方法将指令（或指令组）作为参数，并在计划此指令时一个接一个地执行它们。"

"To make the program more efficient, often it is desirable to run multiple "
"commands at the same time. In this example, the robot is getting ready to "
"grab a soda can. Since the robot isn't holding anything, all the joints can "
"move at the same time without worrying about dropping anything. Here all the"
" commands are run in parallel so all the motors are running at the same time"
" and each completes whenever the ``isFinished()`` method is called. The "
"commands may complete out of order. The steps are: (1) move the wrist to the"
" pickup setpoint, then (2) move the elevator to the floor pickup position, "
"and (3) open the claw"
msgstr ""
"为了使程序更高效，经常需要同时运行多个指令。在此示例中，机器人准备抓汽水罐。由于机器人没有握住任何东西，因此所有关节都可以同时移动，而不必担心会掉落任何东西。这里所有指令都是并行运行的，因此所有电动机都同时运行，当调用isFinished（）方法时就一起停止。指令可能会无序完成。步骤是：（1）将手腕移至拾音器设定点，然后（2）将电梯移至地面拾音器位置，以及（3）打开卡爪"

"Often there are some parts of a command group that must complete before "
"other parts run. In this example, a soda can is grabbed, then the elevator "
"and wrist can move to their stowed positions. In this case, the wrist and "
"elevator have to wait until the can is grabbed, then they can operate "
"independently. The first command (1) ``CloseClaw`` grabs the soda and "
"nothing else runs until it is finished since it is sequential, then the (2) "
"elevator and (3) wrist move at the same time."
msgstr ""
"通常，指令组的某些部分必须在其他部分运行之前完成。在此示例中，抓住汽水罐，然后升降机和手腕可以移动到其收起位置。在这种情况下，手腕和升降机必须等到抓住罐子后才能独立操作。第一个指令（1）``CloseClaw''（抓爪）抓住苏打水，直到它完成为止没有其他操作，因为它是连续的，然后（2）升降机和（3）手腕同时运动。"
