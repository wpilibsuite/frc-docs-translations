msgid ""
"In an effort to provide both Teams and Volunteers (FTAs/CSAs/etc.) more "
"information to use when diagnosing robot problems, a number of Warning and "
"Error messages have been added to the Driver Station. These messages are "
"displayed in the DS diagnostics tab when they occur and are also included in"
" the DS Log Files that can be viewed with the Log File Viewer. This document"
" discusses the messages produced by the DS (messages produced by WPILib can "
"also appear in this box and the DS Logs)."
msgstr ""
"了在诊断机器人问题时为团队和志愿者（FTA / CSA / etc。）提供更多信息，已在driver "
"station中添加了许多警告和错误消息。这些消息出现时将显示在DS诊断选项中，并且也包含在DS Log Files，可通过Log File "
"Viewer查看这些消息。本文档讨论了DS产生的消息（WPILib产生的消息也可以出现在此框中和DS日志中）。"

msgid "Joystick Unplugged"
msgstr "没插上的操作柄"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:15
msgid ""
"This error is triggered when a Joystick is unplugged. Contrary to the "
"message text this error will be printed even if the robot is not enabled, or"
" even connected to the DS. You will see a single instance of this message "
"occur each time the Driver Station is started, even if Joysticks are "
"properly connected and functioning."
msgstr ""
"拔下操纵杆时会触发此错误。 与消息文本相反，即使未启用机械手，甚至未将其连接到DS，也会打印此错误。 "
"即使操纵杆已正确连接并正常工作，每次启动Driver Station时，您都会看到此消息的单个实例。"

msgid "Lost Communication"
msgstr "丢失通信"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:26
msgid ""
"This Warning message is printed whenever the Driver Station loses "
"communication with the robot (Communications indicator changing from green "
"to red). A single instance of this message is printed when the DS starts up,"
" before communication is established."
msgstr ""
"每当Driver Station失去与机器人的通信（通信指示灯从绿色变为红色）时，就会打印此警告消息。 "
"在建立通信之前，DS启动时将打印此消息的单个实例。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:29
msgid "Ping Status"
msgstr "ping状态"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:37
msgid ""
"A Ping Status warning is generated each time the Ping Status to a device "
"changes while the DS is not in communication with the roboRIO. As "
"communications is being established when the DS starts up, a few of these "
"warnings will appear as the Ethernet link comes up, then the connection to "
"the robot radio, then the roboRIO (with FMS mixed in if applicable). If "
"communications are later lost, the ping status change may help identify at "
"which component the communication chain broke."
msgstr ""
"DS不与roboRIO通信时，每次设备的Ping状态更改时，都会生成Ping状态警告。 "
"在DS启动时建立通信时，当以太网链接建立，与机器人无线电的连接，然后是roboRIO（如果有FMS的话）连接时，将出现一些警告。 "
"如果以后丢失了通信，则ping状态更改可能有助于确定通信链中哪个组件断开连接。"

msgid "Time Since Robot Boot"
msgstr "自机器人启动后时间"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:48
msgid ""
"This message is printed each time the DS begins communicating with the "
"roboRIO. The message indicates the up-time, in seconds, of the roboRIO and "
"can be used to determine if a loss of communication was due to a roboRIO "
"Reboot."
msgstr ""
"每次DS开始与roboRIO通信时，都会打印此消息。 "
"该消息指示roboRIO的正常运行时间（以秒为单位），可用于确定是否由于roboRIO重新启动而导致通信丢失。"

msgid "Radio Detection Times"
msgstr "信号检测时间"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:63
msgid ""
"This message may be printed when the DS begins communicating with the "
"roboRIO and indicates the time, in seconds, since the last time the radio "
"was lost and seen. In the first example image above the message indicates "
"that the roboRIO's connection to the radio was lost 19 seconds before the "
"message was printed and the radio was seen again right when the message was "
"printed. If multiple radioLost or radioSeen events have occurred since the "
"roboRIO booted, up to 2 events of each type will be included, separated by "
"commas."
msgstr ""
"当DS开始与roboRIO通信时，可能会打印此消息，并指示自上次丢失和看到无线电以来的时间（以秒为单位）。 "
"在消息上方的第一个示例图像中，该消息指示roboRIO与无线电的连接在消息被打印之前19秒钟已丢失，并且在消息被打印时就再次看到了无线电。 "
"如果自启动roboRIO以来发生了多个radioLost或radioSeen事件，则将包括每种类型的最多2个事件，并以逗号分隔。"

msgid "No Robot Code"
msgstr "没有代码"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-errors-warnings.rst:74
msgid ""
"This message is printed when the DS begins communicating with the roboRIO, "
"but detects no robot code running. A single instance of this message will be"
" printed if the Driver Station is open and running while the roboRIO is "
"booting as the DS will begin communication with the roboRIO before the robot"
" code finishes loading."
msgstr ""
"DS开始与roboRIO通信但未检测到运行中的机械人代码时，将显示此消息。 如果在启动roboRIO时Driver "
"Station已打开并正在运行，则将打印此消息的1个实例，因为DS将在机器人代码完成加载之前开始与roboRIO通信。"
