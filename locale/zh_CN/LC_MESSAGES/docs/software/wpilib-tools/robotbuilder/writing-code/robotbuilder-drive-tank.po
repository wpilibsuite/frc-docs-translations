"A common use case is to have a joystick that should drive some actuators "
"that are part of a subsystem. The problem is that the joystick is created in"
" the RobotContainer class and the motors to be controlled are in the "
"subsystem. The idea is to create a command that, when scheduled, reads input"
" from the joystick and calls a method that is created on the subsystem that "
"drives the motors."
msgstr ""
"一个常见的用例是有一个操纵杆来驱动作为子系统一部分的一些执行器。问题是操纵杆是在 RobotContainer "
"类中创建的，要控制的电机在子系统中。这个想法是创建一个指令，在调度时从操纵杆读取输入并调用在驱动电机的子系统上创建的方法。"

msgid ""
"The last step is to make the Tank Drive command be the \"Default Command\" "
"for the Drive Train subsystem. This means that whenever no other command is "
"using the Drive Train, the Joysticks will be in control. This is probably "
"the desirable behavior. When the autonomous code is running, it will also "
"require the drive train and interrupt the Tank Drive command. When the "
"autonomous code is finished, the DriveWithJoysticks command will restart "
"automatically (because it is the default command), and the operators will be"
" back in control. If you write any code that does teleop automatic driving, "
"those commands should also \"require\" the DriveTrain so that they too will "
"interrupt the Tank Drive command and have full control."
msgstr ""
"最后一步是使 Tank Drive 指令成为 Drive Train 子系统的“默认指令”。这意味着只要没有其他指令使用 Drive "
"Train，操纵杆将处于控制之中。这可能是理想的行为。当自动阶段代码运行时，它还需要传动系统并中断 Tank Drive "
"指令。自动阶段代码完成后，DriveWithJoysticks "
"指令将自动重新启动（因为它是默认命令），操作员将重新获得控制权。如果您编写任何执行遥控自动驾驶的代码，这些指令也应该“需要”DriveTrain，以便它们也会中断"
" Tank Drive 指令并拥有完全控制权。"
