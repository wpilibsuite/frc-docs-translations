"Without sensors and sensing robots are really radio controlled vehicles. "
"Sensors allow the robots to understand the internal operation of the robots "
"mechanical systems as well as the ability to interact with the environment "
"around the robot. In these videos, WPI Professor Craig Putnam describes a "
"number of classes of sensors, how they are used, and provides guidance on "
"what sensors are best for your applications."
