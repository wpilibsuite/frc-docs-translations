"In practice, there is no way to measure a \"true\" analog signal with a "
"digital device such as a computer (like the roboRIO).  Accordingly, the "
"analog inputs are actually measured as a 12-bit digital signal - however, "
"this is quite a high resolution [1]_."

"Analog inputs are typically (but not always!) used for sensors whose "
"measurements vary continuously over a range, such as :doc:`ultrasonic "
"rangefinders <ultrasonics-hardware>` and :doc:`potentiometers <analog-"

"proportional to their measurements."

"模拟输入通常（但不总是）用于其测量值在一定范围内连续变化的传感器，例如超声波测距仪<ultrasonics-hardware>和电位计<analog-"
"potentiometers-hardware>，因为它们可以通过输出与测量值成比例的电压进行通信。"
