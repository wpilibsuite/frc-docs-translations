"This feature is mainly useful for coprocessors and unit testing. It allows a"
" single program to be a member of two completely independent "
":term:`NetworkTables` \"networks\" that contain completely different (and "
"unrelated) sets of tables. For most general usage, you should use tables "
"within the single instance, as all current dashboard programs can only "
"connect to a single NetworkTables server at a time."
msgstr ""
"此功能主要对协处理器和单元测试有用。它允许一个程序成为两个完全独立的网络表“网络”的成员，该“网络”中包含完全不同（且不相关）的表集。对于大多数的常规用途，由于当前所有仪表板程序一次只能连接到一个网络表服务器，您应该在单个网络表实例中使用表。"

msgid ""
"Normally the \"default\" instance is set up on the robot as a server, and "
"used for communication with the dashboard program running on your driver "
"station computer. This is what the SmartDashboard and LiveWindow classes "
"use."
msgstr ""
"通常，“默认”实例在机器人上作为服务器设置，并用于与在Driver "
"Station计算机上运行的仪表板程序进行通信。这就是SmartDashboard和LiveWindow类的用途。"

msgid ""
"If you had a coprocessor and wanted to have a set of tables that's shared "
"only between the coprocessor and the robot, you could set up a separate "
"instance in the robot code that acts as a client (or a server) and connect "
"the coprocessor to it, and those tables will NOT be sent to the dashboard."
msgstr ""
"如果您有一个协处理器，并且希望有一组仅在协处理器和机器人之间共享的表，则可以在机器人代码中设置一个单独的实例来充当客户端（或服务器）并将协处理器连接到该实例。这些表将不会发送到仪表盘程序。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/software/networktables/multiple-instances.rst:10
msgid ""
"Similarly, if you wanted to do unit testing of your robot program's "
"NetworkTables communications, you could set up your unit tests such that "
"they create a separate client instance (still within the same program) and "
"have it connect to the server instance that the main robot code is running."
msgstr ""
"同样，如果您要对机器人程序的网络表通信进行单元测试，则可以设置单元测试，以使它们创建一个单独的客户端实例（仍在同一程序内）并将其连接到运行在主机器人代码上的服务器实例。"

msgid ""
"Another example might be having two completely separate dashboard programs. "
"You could set up two NetworkTables server instances in your robot program "
"(on different TCP ports of course), set up different tables on each one, and"
" have each dashboard connect to a different server instance. Each dashboard "
"would only see the tables on its instance."
msgstr ""
"另一个示例是关于具有两个完全独立的仪表板程序的情况。您可以在机器人程序中设置两个网络表服务器实例（当然在不同的TCP端口上），在每个实例上设置不同的表，并使每个仪表板连接到不同的服务器实例。每个仪表板只能看到其实例上的表。"
