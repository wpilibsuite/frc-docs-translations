"Adding code to create an actual working subsystem is very straightforward. "
"For simple subsystems that don't use feedback it turns out to be extremely "
"simple. In this section we will look at an example of a `Claw` subsystem. "
"The `Claw` subsystem also has a limit switch to determine if an object is in"
" the grip."

"添加代码以创建实际工作子系统非常简单。对于不使用反馈的简单子系统，结果证明非常简单。在本节中，我们将看一个 `Claw` 子系统的示例。 `Claw` "

"The claw at the end of a robot arm is a subsystem operated by a single "
"VictorSPX Motor Controller. There are three things we want the motor to do, "
"start opening, start closing, and stop moving. This is the responsibility of"
" the subsystem. The timing for opening and closing will be handled by a "
"command later in this tutorial. We will also define a method to get if the "
"claw is gripping an object."
