"If you have an indicator on your dashboard that you expect to be changing it"
" may be fairly trivial to recognize if the Dashboard is connected. If not, "
"there is a way to check without making any changes to your robot code. On "
"the Variables tab of the Dashboard, the variables are shown with a black "

" to the robot and these variables are synced, the diamond will disappear."

"如果您的仪表板上有一个会变动的指示器，那么识别仪表板是否已连接可能相当简单。如果没有，有一种方法可以在不更改机器人代码的情况下进行检查。在仪表板的“变量”选项卡上，当变量未与机器人同步时，变量将显示为黑色菱形。一旦仪表板连接到机器人且如果这些变量同步，菱形就会消失。"
