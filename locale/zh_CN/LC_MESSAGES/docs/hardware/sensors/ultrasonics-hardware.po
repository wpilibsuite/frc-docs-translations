"Ultrasonic rangefinders are some of the most common rangefinders used in "
"FRC\\ |reg|.  They are cheap, easy-to-use, and fairly reliable.  Ultrasonic "
"rangefinders work by emitting a pulse of high-frequency sound, and then "
"measuring how long it takes the echo to reach the sensor after bouncing off "
"the target.  From the measured time and the speed of sound in air, it is "
"possible to calculate the distance to the target."

"超声波测距仪是FRC \\ | reg "
"|中最常用的一些测距仪。它们便宜，易于使用且相当可靠。超声波测距仪的工作原理是发出高频声音脉冲，然后测量从目标弹回后回声到达传感器所需的时间。根据测得的时间和空气中的声速，可以计算到目标的距离。"

"Ultrasonic sensors are generally quite easy to use, however there are a few "
"caveats.  As ultrasonics work by measuring the time between the pulse and "
"its echo, they generally measure distance only to the *closest* target in "
"their range.  Thus, it is extremely important to pick the right sensor for "
"the job.  The documentation for ultrasonic sensors will generally include a "
"picture of the \"beam pattern\" that shows the shape of the \"window\" in "
"which the ultrasonic will detect a target - pay close attention to this when"
" selecting your sensor."
msgstr ""
"超声波传感器通常很容易使用，但是有一些警告。超声波通过测量脉冲与其回波之间的时间来工作，因此它们通常仅测量距其范围内“最近”目标的距离。因此，为工作选择合适的传感器非常重要。超声波传感器的文档通常会包含“光束图案”的图片，该图片显示超声波将在其中检测到目标的“窗口"
"”的形状-选择传感器时请特别注意。"

"Ultrasonic sensors are also susceptible to interference from other "
"ultrasonic sensors.  In order to minimize this, the roboRIO can run ping-"
"response ultrasonics in a \"round-robin\" fashion - however, in competition,"
" there is no sure way to ensure that interference from sensors mounted on "
"other robots does not occur."
msgstr ""
"超声波传感器还容易受到其他超声波传感器的干扰。为了最大程度地减少这种情况，roboRIO可以“循环”方式运行ping响应超声波-"
"但是，在竞争中，无法确定会不会受到来自其他机器人上安装的传感器的干扰。"

"Finally, ultrasonics may not be able to detect objects that absorb sound "
"waves, or that redirect them in strange ways.  Thus, they work best for "
"detecting hard, flat objects."
msgstr "最后，超声波可能无法检测吸收声波或以八仙过海各显神通地重定向声波的物体。因此它最适用于检测坚硬的扁平物体。"
