"The following program starts automatic capture of a USB camera like the "
"Microsoft LifeCam that is connected to the roboRIO. In this mode, the camera"
" will capture frames and send them to the dashboard. To view the images, "
"create a CameraServer Stream Viewer widget using the \"View\", then \"Add\" "
"menu in the dashboard. The images are unprocessed and just forwarded from "
"the camera to the dashboard."

"下面的程序会启动USB相机的自动捕获，就像连接到roboRIO的Microsoft "
"LifeCam。在这种模式下，相机将捕捉帧并将它们发送到仪表盘。要查看图片，使用“view”创建一个CameraServer tream "
"Viewer工具窗，然后在仪表板上创建“Add”菜单。图像未经过处理，只是从相机转发到仪表板。"
