"Characterization constants can sometimes be accurately determined even from "

"However, this sort of encoder noise is problematic for robot code much the "

"setup if this is observed, either by moving the encoders to a different "

"有时甚至可以通过增加加速窗口大小设置，甚至从被该噪声污染的数据中准确确定特征常数。但是，这种编码器噪声对机器人代码来说是有问题的，与对特征化工具来说是有问题的方式非常相似。由于不知道产生噪声的根本原因，因此建议您尝试使用不同的编码器设置，方法是将编码器移至不同的轴上，或将其替换为其他类型的编码器。"
