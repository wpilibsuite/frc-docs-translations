"Pneumatics is an often underused actuation device that can be used on "
"robots. There are many advantages to pneumatics over using motors. In this "
"video Professor Ken Stafford describes the characteristics of pneumatics, "
"applications with robots, and calculating the right sized system for an "
"application."
