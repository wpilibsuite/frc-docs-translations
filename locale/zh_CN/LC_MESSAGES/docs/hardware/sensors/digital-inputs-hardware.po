"A `digital signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>`__ is a "
"signal that can be in one of several discrete states.  In the vast majority "
"of cases, the signal is the voltage in a wire, and there are only two states"
" for a digital signal - high, or low (also denoted 1 and 0, or true and "
"false, respectively)."
msgstr ""
"`数字输入 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>`__ "
"是一个可能处于几种离散状态之一的信号。在大多数情况下，信号就是电线中的电压，数字信号只有两种状态——高或低（分别表示为1和0，或true和false）。"

"peripheral sensors that connect to the DIO ports - there is a constant 5V "
"potential difference between the \"power\" and the \"ground\" pins [3]_ - "
"the \"power\" pin corresponds to the \"high\" state (5V), and the \"ground\""
" to \"low\" (0V).  The signal pin is the pin on which the signal is actually"
