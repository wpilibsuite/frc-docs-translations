"Subsystems are the parts of your robot that are independently controlled "
"like collectors, shooters, drive bases, elevators, arms, wrists, grippers, "
"etc. Each subsystem is coded as an instance of the Subsystem class. "
"Subsystems should have methods that define the operation of the actuators "
"and sensors but not more complex behavior that happens over time."
msgstr ""
"子系统是机器人的独立控制部分，例如收集器，射击器，驱动器底座，电梯，手臂，手腕，抓手等。每个子系统都编码为Subsystem类的实例。子系统应具有定义执行器和传感器操作的方法，但不能定义随时间推移发生的更复杂的行为。"

"This is an example of a fairly straightforward subsystem that operates a "
"claw on a robot. The claw mechanism has a single motor to open or close the "
"claw and no sensors (not necessarily a good idea in practice, but works for "
"the example). The idea is that the open and close operations are simply "
"timed. There are three methods, open(), close(), and stop() that operate the"
" claw motor. Notice that there is not specific code that actually checks if "
"the claw is opened or closed. The open method gets the claw moving in the "
"open direction and the close method gets the claw moving in the close "
"direction. Use a command to control the timing of this operation to make "
"sure that the claw opens and closes for a specific period of time."
msgstr ""
"这是一个相当简单的子系统的示例，该子系统在机器人上操作爪。爪机构只有一个用于打开或关闭爪的电动机，并且没有传感器（在实践中不一定是个好主意，但以示例为例）。这个想法是打开和关闭操作只是定时的。有三种方法可以操作爪形电动机的open（），close（）和stop（）。请注意，没有实际检查爪子是打开还是关闭的特定代码。"
" open方法使爪沿打开方向运动，而close方法使爪沿关闭方向运动。使用命令来控制此操作的时间，以确保爪在特定时间段内打开和关闭。"

"Commands provide the timing of the subsystems operations. Each command would"
" do a different operation with the subsystem, the Claw in this case. The "
"commands provides the timing for opening or closing. Here is an example of a"
" simple Command that controls the opening of the claw.  Notice that a "
"timeout is set for this command (0.9 seconds) to time the opening of the "
"claw and a check for the time in the isFinished() method. You can find more "
"details in the article about :doc:`using commands <../commands/creating-"
"simple-commands>`."
msgstr ""
"命令提供子系统操作的时间。每个命令都会对子系统（在这种情况下为爪）执行不同的操作。这些命令提供了打开或关闭的时间。这是控制爪子打开的简单命令的示例。请注意，为此命令设置了一个超时时间（0.9秒）以计时爪的打开时间并在isFinished（）方法中检查时间。您可以在有关使用命令<../commands"
"/creating-simple-commands>的：doc：`的文章中找到更多详细信息。"
