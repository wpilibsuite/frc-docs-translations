"Proximity switches are switches - they operate a circuit between an \"open\""
" state (in which there *is not* connectivity across the circuit) and a "
"\"closed\" one (in which there *is*).  Thus, proximity switches generate a "
"digital signal, and accordingly, they are almost always connected to the "
"roboRIO's :doc:`digital input <digital-inputs-hardware>` ports."
msgstr ""
"接近开关是开关-"

"Proximity switches can be either \"normally-open,\" in which activating the "
"switch closes the circuit, or \"normally closed,\" in which activating the "
"switch opens the circuit.  Some switches offer *both* a NO and a NC circuit "
"connected to the same switch.  In practice, the effective difference between"
" a NO and a NC switch is the behavior of the system in the case that the "
"wiring to the switch fails, as a wiring failure will almost always result in"
" an open circuit.  NC switches are often \"safer,\" in that a wiring failure"
" causes the system to behave as if the switch were pressed - as switches are"
" often used to prevent a mechanism from damaging itself, this mitigates the "
"chance of damage to the mechanism in the case of a wiring fault."

"Limit switches vary in size, the geometry of the switch-arm, and in the "

"磁性接近开关可以是“单极”，“双极”或“全极”。单极开关根据磁铁的给定磁极的存在（根据开关的不同，是南极还是北极）来激活和停用。双极开关从一个极的附近激活，而从相对极的附近去激活。全极性开关将在任一极存在时激活，并在没有磁体的情况下禁用。"
