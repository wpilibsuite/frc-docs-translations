"This example provides some suggestions for controlling the robot using "
"keyboard navigation in place of a joystick or other controller.  In this "
"case, we use the A, W, S, and D keys to control two drive motors in a tank "
"drive configuration."
msgstr ""
"该示例为使用键盘导航代替操纵杆或其他控制器来控制机器人提供了一些建议。在这种情况下，我们使用A，W，S和D键来控制油箱驱动配置中的两个驱动马达。"

"The first VI Snippet is the code that will need to be included in the "
"Dashboard Main VI.  You can insert this code into the True case of Loop 1.  "
"The code opens a connection to the keyboard before the loop begins, and on "
"each iteration it reads the pressed key.  This information is converted to a"
" string, which is then passed to the Teleop VI in the robot project.  When "
"Loop 1 stops running, the connection to the keyboard is closed."
msgstr ""
"第一个 VI 片段中的代码需要被包含在操作面板的主 VI。您可以将此代码插入到“循环1” 的 True "
"情况下。该代码在循环开始之前打开了与键盘的连接，并且在每次迭代中它都读取按下的键。该信息将转换为字符串，然后传递至机器人项目中的Teleop "
"VI。当循环1停止运行时，与键盘的连接将关闭。"

"The second VI Snippet is code that should be included in the Teleop VI.  "
"This reads the string value from the Dashboard that indicates which key was "
"pressed.  A Case Structure then determines which values should be written to"
" the left and right motors, depending on the key.  In this case, W is "
"forward, A is left, D is right, and S is reverse.  Each case in this example"
" runs the motors at half speed.  You can keep this the same in your code, "
"change the values, or add additional code to allow the driver to adjust the "
"speed, so you can drive fast or slow as necessary.  Once the motor values "
"are selected, they are written to the drive motors, and motor values are "
"published to the dashboard."
msgstr ""
"第二个 VI 片段代码应包含在遥控 VI 中。此片段将从仪表板读取被按下键位的字符串值。然后，一个 “案例结构” "
"根据按下的键确定应将哪些值写入左右电机。如图中样例所示，W为正向，A为左，D为右，S为反向；每种情况均以半速运行电机。您可以选择原封不动，更改特定值或添加其他代码以允许驱动程序调整速度，以根据需要快速或慢速行驶。电机值被输入后，它们将被写入驱动电机，并且被发布到仪表板上。"
