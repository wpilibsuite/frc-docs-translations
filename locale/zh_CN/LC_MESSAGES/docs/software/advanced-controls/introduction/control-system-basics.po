"Control systems are all around us and we interact with them daily. A small "
"list of ones you may have seen includes heaters and air conditioners with "
"thermostats, cruise control and the anti-lock braking system (ABS) on "
"automobiles, and fan speed modulation on modern laptops. Control systems "
"monitor or control the behavior of systems like these and may consist of "
"humans controlling them directly (manual control), or of only machines "
"(automatic control)."

"Controls engineering is, put simply, the engineering process applied to "
"control theory. As such, it's more than just applied math. While control "
"theory has some beautiful math behind it, controls engineering is an "
"engineering discipline like any other that is filled with trade-offs. The "
"solutions control theory gives should always be sanity checked and informed "
"by our performance specifications. We don't need to be perfect; we just need"
" to be good enough to meet our specifications."

"简单来说，控制工程是应用于控制理论的工程过程。因此，它不仅仅是应用数学。虽然控制理论背后有一些漂亮的数学运算，但是控制工程学是一门工程学，就像其他任何取舍一样。控制理论给出的解决方案应始终通过我们的性能规格进行检查和了解。我们不需要完美；我们只需要能满足我们的规格即可。"
