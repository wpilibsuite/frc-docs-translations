"How can we prove closed-loop controllers on an autonomous car, for example, "
"will behave safely and meet the desired performance specifications in the "
"presence of uncertainty? Control theory is an application of algebra and "
"geometry used to analyze and predict the behavior of systems, make them "
"respond how we want them to, and make them robust to disturbances and "
"uncertainty."
msgstr ""
"例如，在存在不确定性的情况下，我们如何证明自动驾驶汽车上的闭环控制器能够安全运行并满足期望的性能规格?控制理论是一种代数和几何的应用，用来分析和预测系统的行为，使它们按照我们的要求做出反应，并使它们对干扰和不确定性具有鲁棒性。"

"Controls engineering is, put simply, the engineering process applied to "
"control theory. As such, it's more than just applied math. While control "
"theory has some beautiful math behind it, controls engineering is an "
"engineering discipline like any other that is filled with trade-offs. The "
"solutions control theory gives should always be sanity checked and informed "
"by our performance specifications. We don't need to be perfect; we just need"
" to be good enough to meet our specifications."
msgstr ""
"简单来说，控制工程是应用于控制理论的工程过程。因此，它不仅仅是应用数学。虽然控制理论背后有一些漂亮的数学运算，但是控制工程学是一门工程学，就像其他任何取舍一样。控制理论给出的解决方案应始终通过我们的性能规格进行检查和了解。我们不需要完美；我们只需要能满足我们的规格即可。"

"Most resources for advanced engineering topics assume a level of knowledge "

"*Gain* is a proportional value that shows the relationship between the "

"The open-loop gain is the total gain from the sum node at the input (the "
