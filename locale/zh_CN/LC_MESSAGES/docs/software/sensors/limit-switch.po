"Limit switches are often used to control mechanisms on robots. While limit "
"switches are simple to use, they only can sense a single position of a "
"moving part. This makes them ideal for ensuring that movement doesn't exceed"
" some limit but not so good at controlling the speed of the movement as it "
"approaches the limit. For example, a rotational shoulder joint on a robot "
"arm would best be controlled using a potentiometer or an absolute encoder, "
"the limit switch could make sure that if the potentiometer ever failed, the "
"limit switch would stop the robot from going to far and causing damage."

"限位开关通常用于控制机器人上的机械装置。虽然限位开关易于使用，但它们只能感应运动部件的单个位置。这使它们成为确保某部件的运动不超过某个极限位置的理想选择，但是它们却不能有效地控制接近极限位置时部件的运动速度。比如说，对于机器人手臂上的可旋转肩关节，最好用电位计或绝对编码器控制，限位开关仅用来确保当电位计发生故障时，阻止机器人走远或造成损坏。"

"Limit switches can have \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" outputs.  "

"限位开关有两个输出：“正常时开启”或“正常时关闭”。这表示有高电平信号输入时，开关是断开还是闭合。要了解有关限位开关硬件的更多信息，参考: "
