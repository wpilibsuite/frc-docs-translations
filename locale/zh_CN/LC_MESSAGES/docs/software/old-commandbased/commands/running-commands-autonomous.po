"Once commands are defined they can run in either the teleop or autonomous "
"part of the program. In fact, the power of the command based programming "
"approach is that you can reuse the same commands in either place. If the "
"robot has a command that can shoot Frisbees during autonomous with camera "
"aiming and accurate shooting, there is no reason not to use it to help the "
"drivers during the teleop period of the game."
msgstr ""
"定义指令后，它们可以在程序的操控部分或自动部分中运行。实际上，基于指令的编程方法的强大之处在于，您可以在任何地方重用相同的指令。如果机器人具有可以在自动阶段中通过相机瞄准和精确射击来射击飞盘的指令，则完全可以在比赛的操控阶段使用它来帮助驾驶员。"
