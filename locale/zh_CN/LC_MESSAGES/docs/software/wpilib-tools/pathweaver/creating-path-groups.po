"Path Groups are a way of visualizing where one path ends and the next one "
"starts. An example is when the robot program drives one path, does something"
" after the path has completed, drives to another location to obtain a game "
"piece, then back again to score it. It's important that the start and end "
"points of each path in the group have common end and start points. By adding"
" all the paths to a single path group and selecting the group, all paths in "
"that group will be shown. Then each path can be edited while viewing all the"
" paths."

"路径组是一种可视化方式，可以定义一条路径的结束，和下一路径的开始。例如，当机器人程序沿一条路径行驶，在该路径完成后执行某些操作，行驶至另一位置以获得比赛需要的零件，然后再次返回以对其进行得分时。重要的是，组中每个路径的起点和终点必须具有相同的终点和起点。通过将所有路径添加到单个路径组并选择该组，将显示该组中的所有路径。然后，可以在查看所有路径的同时编辑每个路径。"
