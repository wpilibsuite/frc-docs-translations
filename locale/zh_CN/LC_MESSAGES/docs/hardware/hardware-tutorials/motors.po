"One of the most important design decisions that teams have to deal with is "
"selecting and designing the motor driven systems on their robot. So often "
"the incorrect motor is chosen for a particular design yielding reduced "
"performance and, sometimes even worse, motors failing from excessive current"
" draw. In this series of videos, WPI Professor Ken Stafford walks through "
"how motors work, how to design systems to operate at maximum performance, "
"and a sample design for a robot system."
