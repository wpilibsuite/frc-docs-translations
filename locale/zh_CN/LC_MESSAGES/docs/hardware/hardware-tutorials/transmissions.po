"Hand in hand with choosing the correct motors for an application is "
"transmitting that motor power to the place it's needed. Using gears or "
"chains and sprockets are two effective ways of matching the motor power to "
"the application being driven. In this video, WPI Robotics Engineering PhD "
"student Michael Delph talks about power transmission, including choosing "
"correct gear or chain and sprocket ratios to get the the maximum performance"
" from your robot design."

"与在应用中选择正确的电机息息相关的，是将电机功率传输到需要的部件。使用齿轮或链条和链轮是两种有效匹配电机功率与应用的方式。在此视频中，WPI "
"机器人工程博士生 Michael Delph 分享了关于动力传递的知识。他讲述了如何为机器人设计出正确的齿轮或链条的链轮比，从而获得最大的性能。"
