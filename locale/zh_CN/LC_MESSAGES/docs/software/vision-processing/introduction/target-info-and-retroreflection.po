"Highly reflective materials are generally mirrored so that light \"bounces "
"off\" at a supplementary angle. As shown above-left, the blue and red angles"
" sum to 180 degrees. An equivalent explanation is that the light reflects "
"about the surface normal the green line drawn perpendicular to the surface. "
"Notice that a light pointed at the surface will return to the light source "
"only if the blue angle is ~90 degrees."
msgstr ""
"高反射率的材料通常会成为镜像，以使光线以补充角度“反射”出去。如左上方所示，蓝色和红色角度总计为180度。一个等效的解释是，光线围绕表面法线反射垂直于该表面绘制的绿线。请注意，仅当蓝角约为90度时，指向表面的光才会返回光源。"

"Retro-reflective materials are not mirrored, but it will typically have "
"either shiny facets across the surface, or it will have a pearl-like "
"appearance. Not all faceted or pearl-like materials are retro-reflective, "
"however. Retro-reflective materials return the majority of light back to the"
" light source, and they do this for a wide range of angles between the "
"surface and the light source, not just the 90 degree case. Retro-reflective "
"materials accomplish this using small prisms, such as found on a bicycle or "
"roadside reflector, or by using small spheres with the appropriate index of "
"refraction that accomplish multiple internal reflections. In nature, the "
"eyes of some animals, including house cats, also exhibit the retro-"
"reflective effect typically referred to as night-shine. The `Wikipedia "
"article on retroreflectors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector>`_ "

"逆反射材料没有镜面，但通常在整个表面上都具有光泽的小平面，或者具有类似珍珠的外观。但是，并非所有刻面或类似珍珠的材料都具有逆向反射性。逆向反射材料将大部分光返回光源，并且它们在表面和光源之间的角度范围很广的情况下进行反射，而不仅仅是在90度的情况下。后向反射材料使用小棱镜，例如在自行车或路边反射镜上找到的棱镜或通过使用具有适当折射率的小球体来实现此目的，这些小球体可以实现多次内部反射。在自然界中，某些动物，包括家猫的眼睛也表现出通常被称为夜光的逆反射效果。维基百科上有关后向反射器<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector>的文章详细介绍了如何实现逆向反射。"

"Experiment with different light sources. The material is hundreds of times "

"尝试使用不同的光源。这种材料的反射性是白色涂料的数百倍。因此昏暗的光源可以正常工作。例如，红色的自行车安全灯将表明光源的颜色决定了反射光的颜色。如果可能，将几个团队成员放置在不同的位置，每个位置都有自己的光源。这将表明效果在很大程度上是独立的，并且材质可以同时为各个团队成员显示不同的颜色。这也表明该材料在很大程度上不受环境光的影响。返回观察者的光几乎完全由他们控制的光源或直接在他们后面的光源决定。使用手电筒，确定环境中已经存在的其他反光物品：衣服，背包，鞋子等上的物品。"
