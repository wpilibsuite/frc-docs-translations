"The Romi is a small and inexpensive robot designed for learning about "
"programming FRC robots. All the same tools used for programming full-sized "
"FRC robots can be used to program the Romi. The Romi comes with two drive "
"motors with integrated wheel encoders. It also includes an IMU sensor that "
"can be used for measuring headings and accelerations. Using it is as simple "
"as writing a robot program, and running it on your computer. It will command"
" the Romi to follow the steps in the program."
