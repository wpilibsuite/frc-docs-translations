"A `digital signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>`__ is a "
"signal that can be in one of several discrete states.  In the vast majority "
"of cases, the signal is the voltage in a wire, and there are only two states"
" for a digital signal - high, or low (also denoted 1 and 0, or true and "
"false, respectively)."

"`数字输入 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>`__ "

"The roboRIO has 10 built-in DIO ports (numbered 0-9), as seen in the image "
"above.  Each port has three pins - signal (\"S\"), power (\"V\"), and ground"

"peripheral sensors that connect to the DIO ports - there is a constant 5V "
"potential difference between the \"power\" and the \"ground\" pins [3]_ - "
"the \"power\" pin corresponds to the \"high\" state (5V), and the \"ground\""
" to \"low\" (0V).  The signal pin is the pin on which the signal is actually"
" measured (or, when used as an output, the pin that sends the signal)."

"All DIO ports have built in \"pull-up\" resistors between the power pins and"

msgstr "所有DIO端口在电源引脚和信号引脚之间都内置了上拉电阻-这些确保当信号引脚“悬空”（即未连接到任何电路）时，它们始终保持在“高电平”位。"
