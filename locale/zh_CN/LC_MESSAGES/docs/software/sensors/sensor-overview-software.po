"In order to be effective, it is often vital for robots to be able to gather "
"information about their surroundings.  Devices that provide feedback to the "
"robot on the state of its environment are called \"sensors.\"  WPILib "
"innately supports a large variety of sensors through classes included in the"
" library.  This section will provide a guide to both using common sensor "
"types through WPILib, as well as writing code for sensors without official "
"support."
