"Highly reflective materials are generally mirrored so that light \"bounces "

" sum to 180 degrees. An equivalent explanation is that the light reflects "
"about the surface normal the green line drawn perpendicular to the surface. "
"Notice that a light pointed at the surface will return to the light source "

"高反射率的材料通常会成为镜像，以使光线以补充角度“反射”出去。如左上方所示，蓝色和红色角度总计为180度。一个等效的解释是，光线围绕表面法线反射垂直于该表面绘制的绿线。请注意，仅当蓝角约为90度时，指向表面的光才会返回光源。"

"Retro-reflective materials are not mirrored, but it will typically have "
"either shiny facets across the surface, or it will have a pearl-like "
"appearance. Not all faceted or pearl-like materials are retro-reflective, "
"however. Retro-reflective materials return the majority of light back to the"
" light source, and they do this for a wide range of angles between the "
"surface and the light source, not just the 90 degree case. Retro-reflective "
"materials accomplish this using small prisms, such as found on a bicycle or "
"roadside reflector, or by using small spheres with the appropriate index of "
"refraction that accomplish multiple internal reflections. In nature, the "
"eyes of some animals, including house cats, also exhibit the retro-"
"reflective effect typically referred to as night-shine. The `Wikipedia "
"article on retroreflectors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector>`_ "

"逆反射材料没有镜面，但通常在整个表面上都具有光泽的小平面，或者具有类似珍珠的外观。但是，并非所有刻面或类似珍珠的材料都具有逆向反射性。逆向反射材料将大部分光返回光源，并且它们在表面和光源之间的角度范围很广的情况下进行反射，而不仅仅是在90度的情况下。后向反射材料使用小棱镜，例如在自行车或路边反射镜上找到的棱镜或通过使用具有适当折射率的小球体来实现此目的，这些小球体可以实现多次内部反射。在自然界中，某些动物，包括家猫的眼睛也表现出通常被称为夜光的逆反射效果。维基百科上有关后向反射器<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector>的文章详细介绍了如何实现逆向反射。"
