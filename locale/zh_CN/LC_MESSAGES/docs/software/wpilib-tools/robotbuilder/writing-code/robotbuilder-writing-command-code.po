"Subsystem classes get the mechanisms on your robot moving, but to get it to "
"stop at the right time and sequence through more complex operations you "
"write Commands. Previously in :doc:`writing the code for a subsystem "
"<robotbuilder-writing-subsystem-code>` we developed the code for the `Claw` "
"subsystem on a robot to start the claw opening, closing, or to stop moving. "
"Now we will write the code for a command that will actually run the claw "
"motor for the right time to get the claw to open and close. Our claw example"
" is a very simple mechanism where we run the motor for 1 second to open it "
"or until the limit switch is tripped to close it."

"RobotBuilder will generate the class files for the `CloseClaw` command. The "
"command represents the behavior of the claw, that is the operation over "
"time. To operate this very simple claw mechanism the motor needs to operate "
"in the close direction,. The `Claw` subsystem has methods to start the motor"
" running in the right direction and to stop it. The commands responsibility "
"is to run the motor for the correct time. The lines of code that are shown "
"in the boxes are added to add this behavior."
