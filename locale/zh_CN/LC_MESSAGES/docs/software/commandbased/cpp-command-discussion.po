"The old command-based framework employed the use of raw pointers, meaning "
"that users had to use ``new`` (resulting in manual heap allocations) in "
"their robot code. Since there was no clear indication on who owned the "
"commands (the scheduler, the command groups, or the user themselves), it was"
" not apparent who was supposed to take care of freeing the memory."
msgstr ""
"基于指令的旧框架使用原始指针，这意味着用户必须在其机器人代码中使用“new'”（导致手动堆分配）。由于没有明确指示谁拥有命令（调度程序，指令组或用户自己），因此不清楚谁应该负责释放内存。"

"Using ``std::unique_ptr`` allows us to clearly determine who owns the "

" more than one instance of a ``std::unique_ptr`` that points to the same "
"block of memory on the heap. For example, a constructor for "
"``SequentialCommandGroup`` takes in a "
"``std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Command>>&&``. This means that it requires an "

msgstr ""
"使用“std::shared_ptr”时，没有明确的所有权模型，因为“std::shared_ptr”可能有多个实例指向同一块内存。如果指令在“std::shared_ptr”实例中，则指令组或指令调度程序将无法获得所有权并在指令完成执行后释放内存，因为用户可能仍然不知不觉中仍然拥有“std::shared_ptr”。指向范围内某处内存块的实例。"
