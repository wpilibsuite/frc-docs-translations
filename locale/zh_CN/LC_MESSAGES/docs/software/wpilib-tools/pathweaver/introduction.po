"Autonomous is an important section of the match; it is exciting when robots "
"do impressive things in autonomous. In order to score, the robot usually "
"need to go somewhere. The faster the robot arrives at that location, the "
"sooner it can score points! The traditional method for autonomous is driving"
" in a straight line, turning to a certain angle, and driving in a straight "
"line again. This approach works fine, but the robot spends a non-negligible "
"amount of time stopping and starting again after each straight line and "
"turn."

"自动阶段是比赛的重要部分。当机器人自主完成令人印象深刻的事情时，大家都会十分兴奋。为了得分，机器人通常需要去某个地方。机器人到达该位置的速度越快，得到分数的速度也就越快。传统的自动驾驶方法是沿直线行驶，转至一定角度，然后再次沿直线行驶。这种方法效果很好，但是机器人在每次直行和转弯之后都要花费大量的时间来停止和重新启动。"
