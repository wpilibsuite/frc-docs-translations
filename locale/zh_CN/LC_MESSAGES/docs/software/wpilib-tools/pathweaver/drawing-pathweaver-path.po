"PathWeaver's primary feature is to visualize trajectories. The following "
"images depict a smooth trajectory that represents a trajectory that a robot "
"might take during the autonomous period. Paths can have any number of "
"waypoints that can allow more complex driving to be described. In this case "
"there are 3 waypoints (including the start and stop) depicted with the "
"triangle icons. Each waypoint consists of a X, Y position on the field as "
"well as a robot heading described as the X and Y tangent lines."
msgstr ""
"路径编织器的主要功能是使轨迹可视化。下图描绘了平滑的轨迹，该轨迹表示机器人在自动阶段可能采取的轨迹。路径可以具有任意数量的导航点，从而可以引导更为复杂的路径。在这种情况下，三角形图标描述了3个航路点（包括起点和终点）。每个导航点均由场地上的X，Y位置以及称为X和Y切线的机器人的航向组成。"

"angle of the tangent vectors changes the shape of the trajectory."
