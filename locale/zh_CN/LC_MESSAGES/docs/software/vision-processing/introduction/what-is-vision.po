"This method involves streaming the camera to the Driver Station so that the "
"driver and manipulator can get visual information from the robot's point of "
"view. This method is simple and takes little time to implement, making it a "
"good option if you do not need features of vision processing."
msgstr ""
"此方法将相机的数据流传输到机器操控台，以便驾驶员和操作手可以从机器人的角度获取视觉信息。这种方法很简单，不需要花费很多时间来实现。如果不需要视觉处理功能，这是一个不错的选择。"

"Instead of only streaming the camera to the Driver Station, this method "
"involves using the frames captured by the camera to compute information, "
"such as a game piece's or target's angle and distance from the camera. This "
"method requires more technical knowledge and time in order to implement, as "
"well as being more computationally expensive. However, this method can help "
"improve autonomous performance and assist in \"auto-scoring\" operations "
"during the teleoperated period. This method can be done using the roboRIO or"
" a coprocessor such as the Raspberry Pi using either OpenCV or programs such"
" as GRIP."

"视觉处理这种方法不仅将相机数据流传输到机器操控台，还会将相机捕获的帧以计算信息，例如计算比赛物件或目标的角度，或计算到相机的距离。该方法需要更多的技术知识和时间来实施，并且在计算上更加消耗资源。但是，此方法有助于提高自动阶段到性能，并在在遥控操作时协助进行“自动得分”的操作。此方法可以使用roboRIO或协处理器（例如树莓派）或OpenCV或GRIP等程序来完成。"
