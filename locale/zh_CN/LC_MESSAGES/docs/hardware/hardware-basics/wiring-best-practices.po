"An FRC\\ |reg| Robot is an incredibly rough environment when it comes to "
"vibrations and shock loads. While many of the FRC specific electronics are "
"extensively tested for mechanical robustness in these conditions, a few "
"components, such as the radio, are not specifically designed for use on a "
"mobile platform. Taking steps to reduce the shock and vibration these "
"components are exposed to may help reduce failures. Some suggestions that "
"may reduce mechanical failures:"
msgstr ""
"FRC\\ |reg| "
"机器人在振动和冲击负荷方面的环境异常恶劣。尽管许多FRC专用电子设备已在这些条件下进行了机械坚固性的广泛测试，但某些组件如无线电设备，并不是专门为在移动平台上使用而设计的。采取措施减少这些组件受到的冲击和振动，可能有助于减少故障。一些可以减少机械故障的建议："

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/hardware-basics/wiring-best-practices.rst:13
msgid ""
"Vibration Isolation - Make sure to isolate any components which create "
"excessive vibration, such as compressors, using \"vibration isolators\". "
"This will help reduce vibration on the robot which can loosen fasteners and "
"cause premature fatigue failure on some electronic components."
msgstr ""
"隔振 - 确保使用隔振器来隔离任何产生过度振动的组件，比如压缩机。这会有助于减少机器整体上的振动，否则，振动会使紧固件松动，并导致某些电子组件过早失效。"

#: ../../frc-docs/source/docs/hardware/hardware-basics/wiring-best-practices.rst:15
msgid ""
"Bumpers - Use Bumpers to cover as much of the robot as possible for your "
"design. While the rules require specific bumper coverage around the corners "
"of your robot, maximizing the use of bumpers increases the likelihood that "
"all collisions will be damped by your bumpers. Bumpers significantly reduce "
"the g-forces experienced in a collision compared to hitting directly on a "
"hard robot surface, reducing the shock experienced by the electronics and "
"decreasing the chance of a shock related failure."
msgstr ""
"保险杠 - "
"使用保险杠来尽量多的覆盖您所设计的机器人。虽然规则上要求在机器人的各个边角处覆盖特定的保险杠，但是最大程度的使用保险杠会大大提高所有碰撞被保险杠缓冲的概率。与直接撞击机器人坚硬的表面相比，保险杠大大的降低了在冲撞时所承受的力量，进而减少了电子设备所受到的冲击，进而降低了相关故障发生的可能性。"

msgid ""
"Shock Mounting - You may choose to shock mount some or all of your "
"electronic components to further reduce the forces they see in robot "
"collisions. This is especially helpful for the robot radio and other "
"electronics such as co-processors, which may not be designed for use on "
"mobile platforms. Vibration isolators, springs, foams, or mounting to "
"flexible materials all may reduce the shock forces seen by these components."
msgstr ""
"避震安装 - "
"您可以选择对某些或全部电子组件进行避震安装，以进一步减小他们在机器人冲撞过程中受到的力量。这对于机器人的无线电以及其他电子组件，例如协处理器尤其有用，因为它们也许并不是专门为了适用于移动的平台而设计的，将这些组件安装到隔振器，弹簧，泡沫或其他柔性材料上都可以减少这些组件所受到的冲击力。"

"For any connections on the Robot or Driver station that may be frequently "

"tether, and Ethernet tether) using a \"Port Saver\" or \"pigtail\" can "
"substantially reduce the potential for damaging the port. This type of "
"device can serve double duty, both reducing the number of cycles that the "
"port on the electronic device sees, as well as relocating the connection to "
"a more convenient location. Make sure to secure the port saver (see the next"
" item) to avoid port damage."
msgstr ""
"使用“端口保护程序”或“尾纤”可以大大减少机器人或 Driver station上经常插拔的任何连接（例如DS操作杆，DS以太网，roboRIO "
"USB线和以太网线）端口损坏的可能性。这种类型的设备可以起到双重作用，既可以减少电子设备上看到的端口周期数，又可以将连接重新定位到更方便的位置。确保安装好端口保护程序（请参阅下一项）以避免端口损坏。"

"Ensure that cables are secured close to connection points, with enough slack"

"wire breaks off at a connection point (these are generally stress "
"concentrators)."
msgstr ""
"确保将电缆固定在连接点附近，并留有足够的松弛空间，以免对连接器造成压力。这称为应力消除，可以最大程度地减小电缆在连接点（这是常见的应力集中地）拔出或导线断开的可能性。"

"标签是补充上述接线文档的好方法。标记电线和电子产品有许多不同的策略，各有其优缺点。电子产品的标签和电线的标志可以手工制作，也可以使用标签制造商（有些也可以制作热缩标签）制成，或者可以使用不同颜色的电工胶带或标记来表示不同的东西。无论选择哪种方法，请确保您了解如何使用它帮助完善您的文档，并确保团队中的每个人都熟悉它。"

"bolt style connections, ensure that the wire/terminal cannot be rotate by "

"Create a checklist for re-checking electrical connections on a regular "
