"Once your drive that controls the wheels is all set, you might need to add "
"an additional motor to control something completely independent of the "
"wheels, such as an arm. Since this motor will not be part of your tank, "
"arcade, or mecanum drive, you'll definitely want independent control of it."
msgstr ""
"一旦你设置好了控制车轮的驱动器，您可能需要添加一个额外的电动机来控制独立于车轮的部件，例如机械臂。由于此马达不会成为坦克，拱形轮或麦克纳姆轮发动机的一部分，因此您绝对希望对其进行独立控制。"

"These VI Snippets show how to set up a single motor in a project that may "
"already contain a multi-motor drive. If you see the HAND>ARROW>LABVIEW "
"symbol, just drag the image into your block diagram, and voila: code! Ok, "
"here's how you do it."
msgstr ""
"这些VI片段展示了如何在可能已经包含多个电机的项目中设置单个电机。如果看到HAND> ARROW> "
"LABVIEW符号，只需将图像拖到框图中，瞧，代码！好的，操作方法如下。"

"FIRST, create a motor reference in the\\ **Begin.vi**, using the \\ **Motor "
"Control Open VI** and \\ **Motor Control Refnum Registry Set VI**. These can"
" be found by right-clicking in the block diagram and going to **WPI Robotics"
" Library>>RobotDrive>>Motor Control**. Choose your PWM line and name your "
"motor. I named mine \"Lift Motor\" and connected it to PWM 7. (I also "
"included and enabled the Motor Control Safety Config VI, which automatically"
" turns off the motor if it loses connection.)"
msgstr ""
"首先，使用“Motor Control Open” VI 和“Motor Control Refnum Registry Set” "
"VI在Begin.vi中创建参考电机。可以通过右键单击程序框图并转到WPI Robotics Library >> RobotDrive >> "
"Motor Control来找到它们。选择您的PWM线并命名您的电动机。我将其命名为“ Lift "
"Motor”，并将其连接到PWM7。（我还使用了Motor Control Safety Config VI，如果失去连接，它将自动关闭电动机。）"

"Now, reference your motor (the name has to be exact) in the **Teleop.vi** "

"现在，使用“Motor Control Refnum Registry Get” "
"VI在Teleop.vi中引用您的电机（名称必须准确），并告诉它用Motor Control Set Output "

"For example, the next snippet tells the Lift Motor to move forward if button"
" 4 is pressed on Joystick 0 and to remain motionless otherwise. For me, "
"button 4 is the left bumper on my Xbox style controller (\"Joystick 0\"). "

"例如，如果按下操纵杆0上的按钮4，则下一个代码片段指示提升马达向前移动，否则保持不动。对我而言，按钮4是Xbox样式控制器（“游戏杆0”）上的左bumper。有关更深入的操纵杆按钮选项的信息，请查看"

"Finally, we need to close the references in the **Finish.vi** (just like we "
"do with the drive and joystick), using the **Motor Control Refnum Registry "
"Get VI** and **Motor Control Close VI**. While this picture shows the Close "
"VI in a flat sequence structure by itself, we really want all of the Close "
"VIs in the same frame. You can just put these two VIs below the other Get "
"VIs and Close VIs (for the joystick and drive)."
msgstr ""
"最后，我们需要使用“Motor Control Refnum Registry Get” VI和“Motor Control Close” "
"VI关闭Finish.vi中的引用（就像对驱动器和操纵杆一样）。该图在一个平面序列结构内单独显示了Close VI，但我们确实希望所有Close "
"VI都在同一帧中。您可以将这两个VI放置在其他Get VI和Close VI下方（用于操纵杆和驱动器）。"
