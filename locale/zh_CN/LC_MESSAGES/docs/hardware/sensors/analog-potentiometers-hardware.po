"Potentiometers generally have a mechanically-limited travel range.  Users "
"should be careful that their mechanisms do not turn their potentiometers "
"past their maximum travel, as this will damage or destroy the potentiometer."
msgstr "电位计通常具有受机械限制的行程范围。用户应注意其机械装置不要使电位计旋转超过最大行程，因为这会损坏或破坏电位计。"

"As suggested by the names, analog potentiometers connect to the roboRIO's "
":doc:`analog input <analog-inputs-hardware>` ports.  To understand how "
"exactly to wire potentiometers, however, it is important to understand their"
" internal circuitry."

"就如其名，模拟电位器需要连接到roboRIO的模拟输入口<analog-inputs-"
"hardware>。但是，若要了解如何精确连接电位计，了解其内部电路非常重要。"

"The picture above on the left shows a typical potentiometer.  There are "
"three pins, just as there are on the RIO's analog inputs.  The middle pin is"
" the signal pin, while the outer pins can both be *either* power or ground."
msgstr "左上方的图片显示了一个典型的电位计。就像RIO的模拟输入口一样，它共有三个引脚。中间引脚是信号引脚，而外部两引脚可以是电源或地线任意一个。"

"As mentioned before, a potentiometer is a voltage divider, as shown in the "
"circuit diagram on the right.  As the potentiometer shaft turns, the "
"resistances R1 and R2 change; however, their sum remains constant [1]_.  "
"Thus, the voltage across the entire potentiometer remains constant (for the "
"roboRIO, this would be 5 volts), but the voltage between the signal pin and "
"either the voltage or ground pin varies linearly as the shaft turns."
msgstr ""
"如前所述，电位器是分压器，如右图所示。随着电位计轴的旋转，电阻R1和R2改变；但是，它们的总和保持不变[1]_。因此，整个电位计上的电压保持恒定（对于roboRIO，这将是5伏），但是信号轴与电源或地线引脚之间的电压随轴旋转而线性变化。"

"Since the circuit is symmetric, it is reversible - this allows the user to "
"choose at which end of the travel the measured voltage is zero, and at which"
" end it is 5 volts.  To reverse the directionality of the sensor, it can "
"simply be wired backwards!  Be sure to check the directionality of your "
"potentiometer with a multimeter to be sure it is in the desired orientation "
"before soldering your wires to the contacts."
msgstr ""
"由于电路是对称的，因此也是可逆的——允许用户选择在行程的哪一端测得的电压为零，在哪一端为5伏。若要反转传感器的方向，只需将其供电引脚反向接线即可！在将电线焊接到触点之前，请务必用万用表检查电位计的方向性，以确保其方向正确。"

"The way this actually works is generally by having the shaft control the "
"position of a contact along a resistive \"wiper\" of fixed length along "
"which the current flows - the resistance is proportional to the length of "
"wiper between the contact and the end of the wiper."
msgstr "其工作原理通常是，电位器旋转轴的刷头与一端固定长度的环状电阻材料想接触，电流从中流过。其阻值与刷头和电阻接触点到电阻材料末端的长度相关。"
