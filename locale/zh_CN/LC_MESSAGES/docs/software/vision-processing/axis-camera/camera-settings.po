"The brightness or exposure of the image also has an impact on the colors "

"saturation will start to drop. Lets look at an example to see how this "
"occurs. A saturated red object placed in front of the camera will return an "
"RGB measurement high in red and low in the other two e.g. (220, 20, 30). As "
"overall white lighting increases, the RGB value increases to (240, 40, 50), "
"then (255, 80, 90), then (255, 120, 130), and then (255, 160, 170). Once the"
" red component is maximized, additional light can only increase the blue and"
" green, and acts to dilute the measured color and lower the saturation. If "
"the point is to identify the red object, it is useful to adjust the exposure"
" to avoid diluting your principal color. The desired image will look "
"somewhat dark except for the colored shine."
msgstr ""
"图像的亮度或曝光也会影响图像的颜色。问题在于，随着整体亮度的增加，色彩饱和度将开始下降。让我们看看这是怎么发生的。将一个红色物体放置在相机的前面，那么它将返回，红色高，其他两个颜色低的RGB测量值，比如（220，20，30）。随着整体亮度的增加，RGB值依次增加到（240、40、50），（255、80、90），（255、120、130）和（255、160、170）。一旦红色的数值最大化，额外的光只能增加到蓝色和绿色的数值上，并起到稀释测得的颜色并降低饱和度的作用。如果要识别红色物体，则调整曝光以避免稀释原色非常有用。所需的图像看起来会有些暗，除了有色的反射。"

"There are two approaches to control camera exposure times. One is to allow "
"the camera to compute the exposure settings automatically, based on its "
"sensors, and then adjust the camera’s brightness setting to a small number "
"to lower the exposure time. The brightness setting acts similar to the "
"exposure compensation setting on SLR cameras. The other approach is to "
"calibrate the camera to use a custom exposure setting. To do this on a 206 "
"or M1011, change the exposure setting to auto, expose the camera to bright "
"lights so that it computes a short exposure, and then change the exposure "
"setting to hold. Both approaches will result in an overall dark image with "
"bright saturated target colors that stand out from the background and are "
"easier to mask."
msgstr ""
"有两种方法可以控制相机的曝光时间。一种是让相机根据其传感器自动计算曝光设置，然后将相机的亮度设置调整为较小的数值以减少曝光时间。亮度设置与SLR相机上的曝光补偿设置相似。另一种方法是校准相机以使用自定义曝光设置。如果要在206或M1011上执行此操作，请将曝光设置更改为自动，让强光照射相机以使其计算出一个短的曝光时间，然后将曝光设置更改为保持。两种方法都将导致整体较暗的图像颜色和明亮的饱和目标颜色，这些目标颜色会在背景中显得十分突出，并且更容易掩盖。"

"The M1013 exposure settings look a little different. The Enable Backlight "
"compensation option is similar to the Auto exposure settings of the M1011 "
"and 206 and you will usually want to un-check this box. Adjust the "
"Brightness and Exposure value sliders until your image looks as desired. The"
" Exposure Priority should generally be set to Motion. This will prioritize "
"framerate over image quality. Note that even with these settings the M1013 "
"camera still performs some auto exposure compensation so it is recommended "
"to check calibration frequently to minimize any impact lighting changes may "
"have on image processing. See :doc:`calibration` for more details."

"M1013的曝光设置看起来有些不同。启用背光补偿选项类似于M1011和206的自动曝光设置，您通常需要取消选中此框。调整“亮度”和“曝光”值滑块，直到图像达到你所需要的效果。通常应将“曝光优先级”设置为“运动”。该设置将使帧频优先于图像质量。请注意，即使使用这些设置，M1013相机仍会执行一些自动曝光补偿，因此建议您经常检查校准，以最大程度地减少任何亮度变化对图像处理的影响。有关更多详细信息，请见：Calibration。"
