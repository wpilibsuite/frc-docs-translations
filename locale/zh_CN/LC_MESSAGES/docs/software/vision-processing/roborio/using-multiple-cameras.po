"If you're interested in just switching what the driver sees, and are using "
"SmartDashboard, the SmartDashboard CameraServer Stream Viewer has an option "
"(\"Selected Camera Path\") that reads the given NT key and changes the "
"\"Camera Choice\" to that value (displaying that camera). The robot code "
"then just needs to set the NT key to the correct camera name. Assuming "
"\"Selected Camera Path\" is set to \"CameraSelection\", the following code "
"uses the joystick 1 trigger button state to show camera1 and camera2."
msgstr ""
"如果您只想改变驱动程序的外观并使用SmartDashboard，SmartDashboard CameraServer Stream "
"Viewer会提供一个选项（“ Selected Camera Path”），该选项读取给定的NT键并将“ Camera "
"Choice”更改为该值（显示该相机）。然后，机器人代码只需要将NT键设置为正确的相机名称即可。假设“选定的相机路径”设置为“ "
"CameraSelection”，以下代码使用操纵杆1触发按钮状态显示camera1和camera2。"

"If you're using some other dashboard, you can change the camera used by the "
"camera server dynamically. If you open a stream viewer nominally to camera1,"
" the robot code will change the stream contents to either camera1 or camera2"
" based on the joystick trigger."
msgstr ""
"如果使用其他仪表板，则可以通过动态更改相机服务器来改变所使用的相机。如果你在名称上选择打开camera1的数据流查看器，则机器人代码将根据操纵杆触发器将流内容更改为camera1或camera2"

"By default, the cscore library is pretty aggressive in turning off cameras "
"not in use. What this means is that when you switch cameras, it may "
"disconnect from the camera not in use, so switching back will have some "
"delay as it reconnects to the camera. To keep both camera connections open, "
"use the ``SetConnectionStrategy()`` method to tell the library to keep the "
"streams open, even if you aren't using them."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，cscore库通常主动地关闭未使用的相机。这意味着当您切换相机时，它可能会与未使用的相机断开连接，因此，在重新连接到相机时，切换回会有一些延迟。即使在没有使用的情况下，也要保持两个相机的连接都打开，请使用“SetConnectionStrategy（）”方法让库保持数据流开放"

"If both cameras are USB, you may run into USB bandwidth limitations with "
"higher resolutions, as in all of these cases the roboRIO is going to be "
"streaming data from both cameras to the roboRIO simultaneously (for a short "
"period in options 1 and 2, and continuously in option 3). It is "
"theoretically possible for the library to avoid this simultaneity in the "
"option 2 case (only), but this is not currently implemented."
msgstr ""
"如果两个相机都是USB端口，则可能会遇到分辨率更高的USB带宽限制，因为在所有这些情况下，roboRIO都将同时将数据从两个相机传输到roboRIO（在选项1和2的短时间内，以及在选项3中连续输入）。从理论上讲，库有可能（仅）在选项2的情况下避免这种同时发生，但目前尚未实现。"

"Different cameras report bandwidth usage differently. The library will tell "
"you if you're hitting the limit; you'll get this error message:"

"If you're using Option 3 it will give you this error during ``RobotInit()``."
" Thus you should just try your desired resolution and adjusting as necessary"
" until you both don't get that error and don't exceed the radio bandwidth "
"limitations."
msgstr ""
"如果您使用的是选项3，则会在“ "
"RobotInit（）”期间出现此错误。因此，你应该只尝试所需的分辨率并根据需要进行调整，直到两边都没有收到该错误提醒并且未超过带宽限制。"
