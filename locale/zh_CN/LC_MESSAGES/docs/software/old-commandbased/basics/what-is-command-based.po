"More complex commands can be built up from simpler commands. For example, "
"shooting a disc may be a long sequence of commands that are executed one "
"after another. Maybe some of these commands in the sequence can be executed "
"concurrently. Command groups are commands, but instead of having an "
"isFinished and execute method, they have a list of other commands to "
"execute. This allows more complex operations to be built up out of simpler "
"operations, a basic principle in programming. Each of the individual smaller"
" commands can be easily tested first, then the group can be tested. More "
"information on command groups can be found in the :doc:`Creating groups of "
"commands article <../commands/creating-groups-commands>`."
msgstr ""
"可以从更简单的指令构建更复杂的指令。例如，发射飞盘可能是一段很长的、顺序执行的指令序列。也许序列中的某些指令可以同时执行。指令组是一种指令，但是除了具有isFinished和execute方法外，它们还有一个其他要执行的指令列表"

"一条编程的基本原则。每个较小的指令中都可以首先轻松地进行测试，然后再对该组进行测试。有关指令组的更多信息，请参见：创建指令组文章<../commands"
