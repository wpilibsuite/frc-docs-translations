"Reading sensor values to determine how far the robot or mechanism from the "

"expected goal. For example, a robot arm with a wrist joint should be able to"
" move to a specified angle very quickly and stop at that angle as indicated "

"读取传感器值以确定机器人或机械装置距所需设定值的距离。设定值是与预期目标相对应的传感器值。例如，带有腕关节的机械臂应该能够非常快速地移动到指定角度并停止在传感器指示的那个角度。电位计是可以测量的旋转角度的传感器，通过将其连接到模拟输入，程序可以获得与角度成正比的电压值。"

"Compute an error (the difference between the sensor value and the desired "
"value). The sign of the error value indicates which side of the setpoint the"

"wrist angle is larger than the desired wrist angle. The magnitude of the "
"error is how far the measured wrist angle is from the actual wrist angle. If"

"计算误差（传感器值与所需值之差）。错误值的符号指示腕关节位于设定点的哪一侧。例如，负值可能表示所测量的腕部角度大于所需的腕部角度。误差的大小是所测得的手腕角度与实际手腕角度之间的距离。如果误差为零，则测量角度与所需角度完全匹配。该误差可用作PID算法的输入，以计算电动机速度。"
