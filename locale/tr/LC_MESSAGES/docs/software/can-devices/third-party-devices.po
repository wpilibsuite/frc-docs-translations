"A number of FRC\\ |reg| vendors offer their own CAN peripherals.  As CAN "
"devices offer expansive feature-sets, vendor CAN devices require similarly "
"expansive code libraries to operate.  As a result, these libraries are not "
"maintained as an official part of WPILib, but are instead maintained by the "
"vendors themselves.  For a guide to installing third-party libraries, see "
":ref:`3rd Party Libraries <docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-"

"Bir dizi FRC \\ |reg| satıcılar kendi CAN çevre birimlerini sunar. CAN "
"cihazları geniş özellik setleri sunduğundan, satıcı CAN cihazlarının "
"çalışması için benzer şekilde genişletilmiş kod kitaplıkları gerekir. Sonuç "
"olarak, bu kitaplıklar WPILib'in resmi bir parçası olarak tutulmaz, bunun "
"yerine satıcıların kendileri tarafından korunur. Üçüncü taraf kitaplıkların "
